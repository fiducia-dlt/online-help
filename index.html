							value: "Ads.txt",
							label: "<p>The following section describes what ads.txt is and how you should use this information.\nWhat is ads.txt and app-ads.txt Ads.txt and app-ads.txt are standards introduced some years ago by the IAB Tech Lab. They require publishers to list all of the companies who are authorized to sell their inventory in a specific format, at a specific location—for both websites (ads.txt) and applications (app-ads.txt). The objective of these standards are to reduce fraud by allowing buyers to identify those companies who are authorized to sell a publisher’s inventory. If a company is not on this list and is trying to sell a publisher’s inventory then it is likely fraudulent. It is a best practice to only buy from websites and apps that have an ads.txt or app-ads.txt file, and only from sellers who are authorized to sell it, to reduce the chances that you are buying fraudulent inventory. For more information click here: https:\/\/iabtechlab.com\/ads-txt\/.\nHow is TAG TrustNet checking if websites and applications have these files? TAG TrustNet has built its own web crawler to check if ads.txt files are present on websites, and is using a webcrawler from the IAB Tech Lab to check if app-ads.txt files are present on apps.\nWhat does it mean if the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file? As indicated above, the IAB spec requires that these files must contain this authorized seller data in a specific format at a specific location. If the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file it is likely it means one of the following:\n The file does not exist the domain or app that was provided in the DSP log file was invalid, and it is not possible to find the related ads.txt or app-ads.txt file (for example, comcast.tubitv or j00kdsgdsdk) The file is formatted incorrectly (according to the IAB specification). There is some other technical problem with it meeting the IAB specification.  </p><p>ads.txt</p><p>app-ads.txt</p><p></p>",

Today it has become a large $200B market that continues to grow at an accelerated pace with a supply chain that remains complex, fragmented, partly opaque and could be even more efficient. In a context where decisions are increasingly made by technology, traditional processes do not apply and there is a need to bring a technological solution to what is essentially a technological problem.\nAs a global cross-industry initiative, TAG TrustNet is taking the industry to the next level as an always-on collaborative network providing the tools to certify the supply chain and allow everyone to be accountable, make responsible decisions and improve efficiency.\nTAG TrustNet achieves this by automating the reconciliation of data across the supply chain and recording it in an immutable shared ledger as Shared Truth: a unified record for every single ad running through the supply chain made available in near real-time.\nWith Shared Truth, TAG TrustNet enables what can be defined as Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles:\n Know your business partners: every record can be tracked back to the legal entities that are part of a transaction Know their business practices: every record gets cross-checked and verified based on financial and qualitative metrics Make timely informed business decisions: every record gets reconciled and can be acted on in near real-time  As an always-on solution, TAG TrustNet sets a major industry milestone:\n For the industry as a whole by allowing everyone to act responsibly by conducting business transactions only with identified business partners; For advertisers and agencies by increasing cost efficiency and ad effectiveness, resulting in improved brand safety and ad spend productivity; For intermediaries and publishers by getting the opportunity to access to a larger share of ad spend as identified business partners agreeing to share impression data; and For all members by reducing operating costs over the automation of data reconciliation in a data secure and private context.  Accessing TAG TrustNet is a free and easy process. Members sign a membership agreement, get verified as an existing legal business entity, get identified by a tracking ID and agree to share their impression data with their business partners through TAG TrustNet based on member requirements. In a second step, after signing a licensing agreement, a dedicated network node gets activated over which data can be imported, shared and exported. Access to data remains at all times under the control of the data owner.\nTAG TrustNet’s objective is for the entire digital advertising industry to adopt and implement the 3 principles of Responsible Advertising by becoming members and leveraging TAG TrustNet to shape a responsible future for our industry.\nThe time for TRUST is now! </p><p></p>",

The following information is provided in this section:\n Supply Chain Report Overview TrueImpression Other Ad Effectiveness Metrics Cost Efficiency Metrics   Supply Chain Report Overview\nSupply Chain Vendor Types This report uses a Sankey diagram to show the inventory flowing from the publishers on the right all the way to the ad server to the left. Wider lines between the vendor types indicate a greater volume or spend. The four thick vertical lines that are evenly spaced across the report show (from left to right) the ad server(s), DSP(s), exchanges\/SSPs, and Publishers (see below).\nIn addition, there is a key in the lower left of the diagram. This key shows how well the inventory (represented by the horizontal lines between the different supply chain vendors) meet the selected metric based on the color of the line. The color at the top of this key indicates the inventory met the highest level of the selected metric.\nData About the Inventory Between Vendor Types If you hover over the lines that appear between the different vendor types, you will see data about the inventory that is flowing between them. In the example below, the person has hovered over the line between the DSP and the Google AdX exchange–resulting in a tooltips box appearing that provides information specifically about the inventory from Google AdX that the DSP has purchased.\nTAG Certifications You can also see which vendors in your supply chain are certified for any of the four TAG programs (Brand Safey Certified, Certified Against Fraud, and Certified Against Malware). In the example below Brand Safety Certified has been selected. The vendors whose name or column\/box are black indicate that they are currently enrolled in this program, and the ones in red are not. Note: the screen below is used just for illustrative purposes and does not indicate the current status of these companies.\nUsing the Supply Chain Report TrueImpression\nThe objective of having TrueImpression or TrueAdSpend is to have a single metric that you can use to measure overall ad effectiveness. It is suggested by TAG TrustNet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency.\nIn TAG TrustNet the default definition for a TrueImpression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and Ad Verification tool), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the Ad Verification tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request, and can be based on any combination of the metrics that appear within the Supply Chain Report.\nOther Ad Effectiveness Metrics\nThere are a number of other metrics in the Supply Chain Report that allow you to assess your ad effectiveness by answering the following questions:\n Was the impression matched across the log files received from different supply chain vendor types (ad server, Ad Verification, DSP, and Exchange\/SSP)? Was the timestamp of the impression that was recorded in the log files of the ad server, Ad Verification, and DSP platforms within 1 minute? Was the impression recorded only once by both the DSP and exchange? Was the same domain recorded by the Ad Verification tool and DSP for the impression? If the domains match this indicates that there was unlikely to be any domain spoofing. Did the exchange\/SSP purchase the impression directly from the publisher? Does the publisher have an ads.txt file for that impression? Does the exchange\/SSP have an sellers.json file for that impression? Is the publisher ID in the log file from the exchange\/SSP consistent with what is stated in both the ads.txt and sellers.json file? Is the entire supply chain TAG Certified Against Fraud? Is the entire supply chain TAG Brand Safety Certified? Does the impression meet any number of the standard Ad Verification tool criteria (Measureable, Brand Safe, non-IVT, Viewable, etc.)  Cost Efficency Metrics\nThere are a number of metrics in the Supply Chain Report that allow you to assess your cost efficiency by answering the following questions:\n Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data with the impression? Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data, along with the clearing price with the impression? What percent of the ad spend went directly to the publisher for the impression?   </p><p></p>",

The TrueImpression metric is typically defined by 5-7 other metrics. This report allows you to see how each of your partners are performing against all 5-7 metrics without having to run a bunch of individual queries.\nFiltering Options It is important to highlight that the data above can be viewed with a few options at the top of the screen. These options are highlighted in the blue ovals above.\nShow with metrics less than If you want to see the exchanges or domains that have True metrics at or below a specific number this slider control can be used for this. For example, if you want to see only exchanges that had one or more of their metrics below 60%, you could set this control to 60%. All other exchanges will not be displayed.\nVendor Type In this filter you have the following options:\n Exchanges: this will list all of the exchanges and their corresponding metrics. Publisher\/Domains: this will list all of the domains and their corresponding metrics.  Exchange or publisher\/domain This field will allow you to filter the data in this report to a specific exchange or domain.\nBar color codes The following are the meanings for the different colored bars:\n Green bar: The metric has met the TrueImpression definition. Red bar: The metric has NOT met the TrueImpression definition. Light gray bar: The required data is not available to determine if the metric has met the TrueImpression definition or not.  </p><p>True</p>",

This person will be the Node User Administrator for your TAG TrustNet node. Once this is done, all requests to set up user accounts on your node should be directed to your Node User Administrator.\nExisting Node If you have an existing node on TAG TrustNet and someone needs an account to access it, please contact the TAG TrustNet Node User Administrator in your company to set this up. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know who this is you can contact us at support@tagtrust.net.\nCannot Get Access to Your Account If you have an account and cannot access it, contact your Node User Administrator.

If a new user account is required, the person who is the Node User Administrator for the node at that company should be contacted to set it up. The information that will be needed to set up a new account is:\n First and last name Email address Type of role. See below for the types of roles available. Country restrictions (optional) (advertiser and agency nodes only) Advertiser restrictions (optional) (agency nodes only)  If you don\u0026rsquo;t know who the Node User Administrator is for your company, please contact us at support@tagtrust.net.\nCreating a user account For Node User Administrators, here is how you create a new user account:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. On the top-right of the screen below, click on the \u002b NEW USER button. Enter the user name (first and last) and the email address. Select the user role (see below for a description for each one).

Click it and select \u0026ldquo;Reset Password\u0026rdquo; Send the link to the user by email by copying the link in the dialog window and pasting it into an email. You may want to also include the URL of the node.  Settings for user accounts The following describes in more detail the settings for setting-up user accounts.\nUser Roles  Node User Administrator: This role is able to create new accounts for users in the node, as well as view all screens for all countries (for advertiser and agency nodes) and all advertisers (for agency nodes). This role can also create user accounts that can be Node User Administrators. Benchmark Report Viewer: This role will have access to the BenchMark report. Business Metrics Viewer (advertiser or agency node only): The access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Dashboard and Insights options in the top navigation bar. Data Manager:  for advertiser and agency nodes, the access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Data Feeds option in the top navigation bar. for all ad server, Ad Verification tool, DSP, Exchange\/SSP, and Publisher nodes the access for this role will be limited to the Data Feeds in the top navigation bar.    If the Node User Administrator has been selected, no other roles can be selected (since the Node User Administrator can view all screens that are available to the other roles). The other three roles can be selected in any combination (based on their availability).\nCountries (advertiser and agency nodes only) This will allow users who have been assigned the Business Metrics Viewer role to have their access to be restricted to one or more countries. This setting does not impact the screens or data available to the BenchMark Viewer or Data Manager role.\nAdvertiser Restriction (agency node only) When the Business Metrics Viewer role is selected, and at least one country has been selected, the access for a user can be restricted to one or more advertisers. This setting will impact all screens that the Business Metrics Viewer has access to (for details on these screens, see User Roles above).\nMaking an account active or inactive The user\u0026rsquo;s account can be changed to be active or inactive by the is active control. If it is inactive the user is not allowed to login to their TAG TrustNet node. Accounts are not allowed to be deleted in order to maintain user data integrity.\nResetting a password If a user has forgotten their password or has been locked out of their account after 3 failed logins, the Node User Adminstrator should follow these steps to reset the password:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. Select the All users view. Find the row that has the account that needs the password reset. On the far right of that row there is an icon with three dots. Click it and select \u0026ldquo;Reset Password\u0026rdquo; Click the link Send Link by Email and an email will automatically be sent to the user to reset their password (the email will be sent from TAG TrustNet and the subject will be Reset Password).

Other Account Information Time-out If a users account is inactive for 30 minutes the user will need to login again.\n3 Failed Logins If a user has tried unsuccessfully to login 3 times, the account will be locked. The only way the user can get access to their account is to have their password reset by the Node User Administrator. Instructions on how to do this are above (see Resetting a password).\n2-Factor Authentication If you want 2-Factor authentication enabled for your account please contact TAG TrustNet support (support@tagtrust.net). Once enabled it will be required for every user login. It supports either the Google or Microsoft authentication applications (but only one of these applications per node).\nIf for any reason a user cannot use his device (which has the authentication application) any longer, use of the authentication app can be reestablished on a new device by resetting the password.\n</p><p>access, login, log-in, 2FA, MFA, multifactor, authentication</p>",
