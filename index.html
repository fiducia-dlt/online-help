							value: "Ads.txt",
							label: "<p>The following section describes what ads.txt is and how you should use this information.\nWhat is ads.txt and app-ads.txt This is a standard introduced in 2017 by the IAB. It requires publishers to list all of the companies who are authorized to sell their inventory in specific format, at a specific location—for both websites (ads.txt) and applications (app-ads.txt). The objective of this standard is to reduce fraud by allowing buyers to identify those companies who are authorized to sell a publisher’s inventory. If a company is not on this list and is trying to sell a publisher’s inventory, then it is likely fraudulent. It is a best practice to only buy from websites and apps that have an ads.txt or app-ads.txt file to reduce the chances that you are buying fraudulent inventory. For more information click here: https:\/\/iabtechlab.com\/ads-txt\/.\nHow is TAG TrustNet checking if websites and applications have these files? TAG TrustNet has built its own web crawler to check if the ads.txt or app-ads.txt files are present on websites and apps.\nWhat does it mean if the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file? As indicated above, the IAB spec requires that these files must contain this authorized seller data in a specific format at a specific location. If the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file it can mean one of the following:\n The file does not exist The format of the file is wrong (according to the IAB specification). There is some other technical problem with it meeting the IAB specification.  I only want my DSP to buy from sites that have ads.txt or app-ads.txt files, but I see from the TAG TrustNet report that this is not happening. Why is this happening and what should I do? Almost every DSP and SSP has built their own web crawler to look for ads.txt and app-ads.txt files, and there will be differences in the rules that are used by different crawlers to determine if the files are valid or not. Some options on how to approach your DSP are:\n Send them the TAG TrustNet report that shows the sites and apps without ads.txt or app-ads.txt files and ask them to review this list. Just be aware that some of these websites and apps may actually have an ads.txt file according to your DSP—because the criteria used for determining a valid file is different from the ones used by TAG TrustNet. Manually check all of the domains that do not have these files according to the TAG TrustNet report. For the ones that you can verify do not have these files, ask your DSP to explain why you are buying from them. Note: when you manually check files like this, you WILL see ads.txt files on website and apps that TAG TrustNet said do not have one, because you will not readily see the technical problems that made the file invalid.  </p><p>ads.txt</p><p>app-ads.txt</p><p></p>",

							value: "Dashboard",
							label: "<p> The Dashboard screen is only available on advertiser or agency nodes.\n The purpose of the dashboard is to allow you to easily see the most critical metrics that are tracked by TAG TrustNet everytime you login. For most metrics you have the option to set a goal so that you can see how well these metrics are doing against your goals.\nThe dashboard is comprised of a number of individual panels showing metrics and goals called widgets. These widgets are grouped into two categories, Ad Effectiveness and Cost Efficiency. The widgets can be added, changed, and deleted, in order to customize the dashboard for your account. The following provides information about how to make these changes.\nTime Period The time period for data that is used for the entire dashboard is set at the upper left of the dashboard. You can set this to any time period that you want and this setting will be used when you login in the future.\nChange Existing Widgets Modify Existing Widgets To change the settings for an existing widget:\n Within the widget that you want to change, click on the icon in the top-right corner with the three vertical dots. Select Edit Make the desired changes Click the Save Widget button.  Move Existing Widgets You can easily change the position of widgets on the dashboard by doing the following:\n Hover over the widget that you want to move. A small grid of six dots will appear to the left of the widget name. Click (and hold) on top of the dots and move the widget to the desired location. Once the widget is at the desire location release the mouse button.  Note: You are not allowed to move widgets to different categories (for example from Ad Effectiveness to Cost Efficiency, or vice-versa).\nDelete Existing Widgets In order to delete a widget follow these steps:\n Within the widget that you want to change, click on the icon in the top-right corner with the three vertical dots. Select Remove.  Note: once widgets are removed they cannot be restored (in otherwords, you cannot \u0026ldquo;undo\u0026rdquo; this action). If you accidentally remove a widget you can simply add it back (see Add New Widgets immediately below).\nAdd New Widgets To add a widget follow these steps:\n At the top-right of the dashboard screen click on the \u002b Add Widget button. Select whether you want it to be a a Goal Widget or Over Time widget. As you select these options you can see a preview of what they will look like to the right. Select the metric that you want to use from the drop-down menu. Select whether you want to use Ad Spend or Impressions as the basis for the metrics. Select whether you want to show the metric value or a % in the widget (the preview will show how these options will be displayed) Choose a goal to be used to measure the performance of the metric. This is optional. Click the Add Widget button.  Once the widget is created you can move it to the desired location in the dashboard. Please refer to Move Existing Widgets above.\nNote: most, but not all settings can be changed once you have created a widget. Once you have selected a widget to be a Goal Widget or Over Time widget you cannot change it to be the other type once you select Add Widget. If you want to make this change your only option is to delete the widget and create another one.\n</p><p></p>",

							value: "Glossary",
							label: "<p>Big changes This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md \u002b\u002b\u002b date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; \u002b\u002b\u002b bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md \u002b\u002b\u002b date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; \u002b\u002b\u002b bah and humbug $ Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts\/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts\/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes\/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts\/ and creating it in themes\/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts\/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes\/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes\/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts\/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public\/ directory, our home page is public\/index.html.\nSite Configuration File When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content\/ directory and template files in your themes\/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public\/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “\u002b\u002b\u002b”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~\/Sites\/zafta $ cd ~\/Sites\/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content\/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes\/, layouts\/, and static\/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public\/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that\u0026rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let\u0026rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we\u0026rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.\n$ ls -l public total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 416 Sep 29 17:02 index.xml -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 262 Sep 29 17:02 sitemap.xml $ Hugo created two XML files, which is standard, but there are no HTML files.\nTest the New Site Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public Web Server is available at http:\/\/localhost:1313 Press Ctrl\u002bC to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public\/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default\/list.html, and _default\/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme.

This is the file public\/index.html. Hugo created a css\/ directory. Hugo created a js\/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.  The Home Page Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts\/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 .\/public\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 .\/themes\/zafta\/layouts\/index.html $ The Magic of Static Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css\/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js\/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes\/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes\/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/static\/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/static\/js $ The Theme Development Cycle When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public\/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public\/ Directory When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public\/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content\/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s totally amazing.\u0026rdquo;\nDevelopment Commands Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.\n## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory. ## $ rm -rf public ## ## run hugo in watch mode ## $ hugo server --watch --verbose Here\u0026rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page.

There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page.

We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created.

That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/themes\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme\/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0027*.html\u0027 | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public\/post\/first\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public\/post\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public\/post\/second\/index.html $ cat public\/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts.

All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content\/post\/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default\/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post\/single.html, then _default\/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes\/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html We could create a new template, post\/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File $ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/themes\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme\/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0027*.html\u0027 | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public\/post\/first\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public\/post\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public\/post\/second\/index.html $ cat public\/post\/first\/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; $ cat public\/post\/second\/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

Hugo lets \u0026ldquo;slug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;URL\u0026rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content\/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.\nSharing Templates If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts\/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; :wq $ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/footer.html \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \u0026quot;theme\/partials\/header.html\u0026quot; . }} versus\n{{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/index.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;) (eq .Type \u0026quot;about\u0026quot;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results.

The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.\nAdd “Date Published” to Posts It\u0026rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let\u0026rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes\/zafta\/layouts\/post $ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/post\/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n</p>",

When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md \u002b\u002b\u002b date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; \u002b\u002b\u002b bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md \u002b\u002b\u002b date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; \u002b\u002b\u002b bah and humbug $ Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts\/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts\/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes\/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts\/ and creating it in themes\/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts\/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes\/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes\/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts\/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public\/ directory, our home page is public\/index.html.\nSite Configuration File When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content\/ directory and template files in your themes\/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public\/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “\u002b\u002b\u002b”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~\/Sites\/zafta $ cd ~\/Sites\/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content\/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes\/, layouts\/, and static\/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public\/ directory?

It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public Web Server is available at http:\/\/localhost:1313 Press Ctrl\u002bC to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public\/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default\/list.html, and _default\/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/archetypes\/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public\/index.html. Hugo created a css\/ directory. Hugo created a js\/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.  The Home Page Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts\/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default\/list.html _default\/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 .\/public\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 .\/themes\/zafta\/layouts\/index.html $ The Magic of Static Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css\/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js\/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes\/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes\/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/static\/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/static\/js $ The Theme Development Cycle When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public\/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public\/ Directory When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public\/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content\/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s totally amazing.\u0026rdquo;\nDevelopment Commands Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.\n## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory. ## $ rm -rf public ## ## run hugo in watch mode ## $ hugo server --watch --verbose Here\u0026rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page.

That\u0026rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we\u0026rsquo;ll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.\nMake a Static Home Page Right now, that page is empty because we don\u0026rsquo;t have any content and we don\u0026rsquo;t have any logic in the template.

The homepage doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.\nList and Single Templates In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/themes\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme\/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0027*.html\u0027 | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public\/post\/first\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public\/post\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public\/post\/second\/index.html $ cat public\/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content\/post\/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default\/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post\/single.html, then _default\/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes\/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html We could create a new template, post\/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File $ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014\/09\/29 Using config file: \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/config.toml INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/themes\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 syncing from \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/static\/ to \/Users\/quoha\/Sites\/zafta\/public\/ INFO: 2014\/09\/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014\/09\/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme\/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0027*.html\u0027 | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public\/post\/first\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public\/post\/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public\/post\/second\/index.html $ cat public\/post\/first\/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; $ cat public\/post\/second\/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

Hugo lets \u0026ldquo;slug\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;URL\u0026rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content\/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.\nSharing Templates If you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts\/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; :wq $ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/partials\/footer.html \u0026lt;\/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;\/html\u0026gt; :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \u0026quot;theme\/partials\/header.html\u0026quot; . }} versus\n{{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/index.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026quot;post\u0026quot;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026quot;page\u0026quot;) (eq .Type \u0026quot;about\u0026quot;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the home page is now \u0026ldquo;your title here\u0026rdquo;, which comes from the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable in the config.toml file.\nUpdate the Default Single Template to Use the Partials $ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.\nAdd “Date Published” to Posts It\u0026rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let\u0026rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes\/zafta\/layouts\/post $ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/_default\/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes\/zafta\/layouts\/post\/single.html {{ partial \u0026quot;header.html\u0026quot; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;\/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026quot;footer.html\u0026quot; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n</p>",

							label: "<p>This document provides definitions for all the terms and metrics used in the TAG TrustNet Node Manager and documentation.\n   Metric Description     Ad Effectiveness A measurement of how successfully ads are being purchased that meet the goals of a campaign. The goals may include target audience, brand safety, fraud, and other criteria.   Ad Spend The total amount of money spent to purchase impressions programmatically, which includes both delivery costs and media spend.   Ad Spend Productivity A measurement of buying ads using the least amount of ad spend to meet the goals of a campaign. This measure combines both ad effectiveness and cost efficiency   Ad Spend received by Publisher The percent of the ad spend that is received by the publisher.   Ads.txt implemented Ad spend or impressions where the publisher has an ads.txt or app-ads.txt file. Note: TAG TrustNet crawls the web itself to collect ads.txt data for all domains that appear in customer reports. New domains should be correctly identified in about one business day. For more information about this please see ads.txt in the General Information section.   Ads.txt matches Exchange log file The sellers ID (and seller type if available) in the exchange log file matches what is in the publishers ads.txt or app-ads.txt file.   Allowed Ad spend or impressions meeting the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign and with no violations (blocks for inappropriate content, IVT, or App\/Site\/Language. (DoubleVerify only)   Brand safe Ad spend or impressions determined to be brand safe as determined by the Ad Verification tool.   Brand safe and Non-IVT Ad spend or impressions determined to be both brand safe and non-IVT as determined by the Ad Verification tool.   Consistency of ads.txt, sellers.json, and log-level data The seller ID from the exchange log file matches the seller ID (also called the Publisher’s Account ID) in the publishers ads.txt or app-ads.txt file AND the seller ID in the sellers.json file   Cost difference between DSP and Exchange The DSP media costs minus the exchange recorded winning price.   Cost Efficiency A measurement of how successfully ads are being purchased using the least amount of the ad spend.   Delivery Costs The amount of ad spend paid for impressions that includes everything except the payment to the publisher. Delivery costs typically includes platform fees paid to intermediaries (including ad servers, DSPs and Exchanges) and data.   DSP Data The cost that the DSP charges for using data on its platform.   DSP Media Cost This is the cost that the DSP paid to purchase the impression from the Exchange, as reported by the DSP.   DSP Other This includes any fees that the DSP may charge outside of platform, data, or media.   DSP Platform The fee that the DSP charges for using its platform.   Exchange works with publisher directly Ad spend or impressions where the exchange works with the publisher directly based on its log file records and sellers.json data, along with the publishers ads.txt or app-ads.txt file   Financial data provided by DSP and Exchange Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost   Financial data provided by DSP and Exchange with matching impression costs Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost and clearing price records match   Gross Working Spend The total amount that was paid to the publisher.   Live Compliance Performing compliance checks based on impression log-level data in near real-time of a supply chain to industry regulations, standards, and certifications.   Live Reconciliation Harmonizing, matching, and recording impression delivery log records across a supply chain in near real-time.   Matched by ad server, Ad Verification tool, and DSP Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, Ad Verification tool, and DSP   Matched by ad server, Ad Verification tool, DSP, and Exchange (beta) Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, Ad Verification tool, DSP, and exchange   Matched by Ad Verification tool Ad spend or impressions that have been recorded by both the Ad Verification tool and DSP.   Matched publisher domain Ad spend or impressions where the ad server, Ad Verification tool, DSP (and exchange data if available) all recorded the same domain.   Matched timestamps Ad spend or impressions that had timestamps recorded within 1 minute for the ad server, Ad Verification tool, and DSP.   Measurable Ad spend or impressions were able to be measured for viewability as determined by the Ad Verification tool.   Media Cost Delta This is the difference between the DSP media cost and the exchange cost (if there is a difference)   Media Spend The amount of ad spend that goes to the publisher.   Monitored Ad spend or impressions where the DoubleVerify monitoring services were applied, were not blocked and had no violations from DoubleVerify. (DoubleVerify only)   Node Manager The TAG TrustNet product that members log into to configure their node, manage users, manage data and access the Supply Chain monitor or other network functionalities.   Non-Blocked Requests Ad spend or impressions where the requests were not blocked because they met the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign. (DoubleVerify only)   Non-IVT Ad Spend or impression is determined to be delivered to a person as determined by the Ad Verification tool.   Qualified Qualified impressions are impressions that meet a set of requirements to measure ad effectiveness. TAG TrustNet enables members to define their own requirements and to evaluate data reconciled across the supply chain against them. TAG TrustNet recommends defining qualified impression requirements based on ad quality, supply chain transparency and data consistency metrics. In TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from the DSP and Ad Verification tool, is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the Ad Verification tool and DSP are the same (except if the Ad Verification tool is not able to provide all domains and\/or app names for an advertiser).   Qualified Viewable Ad spend or impressions that are both qualified (see Qualified above) AND viewable.   Sellers.json implemented Ad spend or impressions where the exchange or SSP has a sellers.json file.   Supply Chain is TAG BSC Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Brand Safety Certified.   Supply Chain is TAG CAF Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Certified Against Fraud.   Supply Chain Report The TAG TrustNet report for an agency or advertiser that uses a Sankey diagram to show data about the flow of inventory across programmatic participants, from the ad server to the publishers.   Unduplicated impressions Ad spend or impressions where the impressions were reported as unique by the DSP.   Unmatched with Ad Verification The amount that was paid to the publisher that was not matched with the Ad Verification log files.   Viewable according to Ad Verification Tool Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the Ad Verification tool being used.   Viewable according to DSP or Ad Server Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the DSP or Ad Server being used. If viewability data is available from both systems the DSP data will be used.    </p><p>glossary</p>",

Some of the cost data is collected by log files and some of the cost data will need to be provided by estimates in order to get a complete picture\u0026ndash;because some cost data is not available from log files.\nCosts\nThe following section provides a decription for each of the costs provided in this report.\n   Name Description     Agency The cost of the agency\u0026rsquo;s services. This data is not available from log files.   Ad Server The costs incurred from the ad server (such as Google CM 360 or Flashtalking). This data is not available from log files.   Ad Verification The costs incurred from the Ad Verification tool (such as DoubleVerify, IAS or MOAT) . This data is not available from log files.   DSP Platform The fee that the DSP charges for using its platform   DSP Data The cost that the DSP charges for using data on its platform.   DSP Other This includes any fees that the DSP may charge outside of platform, data, or media.   DSP Media Cost This is the cost that the DSP paid to purchase the impression from the Exchange, as reported by the DSP.   Media Cost Delta This is the difference between the DSP media cost and the exchange cost (if there is a difference)   Exchange This is the total cost that the exchange charged the DSP.   Gross Working Spend The total amount that was paid to the publisher.   Unmatched with Ad Verification The amount that was paid to the publisher that was not matched with the Ad Verification log files.   Fraud The amount that was paid to the publisher and was determined by the Ad Verification tool to be fraudulent.   Non-brand Safe The amount that was paid to the publisher and was determined by the Ad Verification tool to be non-brand safe.   Non-Viewable The amount that was paid to the publisher and was determined by the Ad Verification tool to be non-viewable.   Viewable The amount that was paid to the publisher and was determined by the Ad Verification tool to be non-fruadulent, brand safe, and viewable.

							label: "<p> responsible advertising for a responsible industry Over the last decade Real-Time Bidding (RTB) created massive efficiency for the digital advertising marketplace in opening large volumes of inventory, driving down prices and creating the opportunity for smaller sites and apps to thrive. Today it has become a large $200B market that continues to grow at an accelerated pace with a supply chain that remains complex, fragmented, partly opaque and could be even more efficient. In a context where decisions are increasingly made by technology, traditional processes do not apply and there is a need to bring a technological solution to what is essentially a technological problem.\nAs a global cross-industry initiative, TAG TrustNet is taking the industry to the next level as an always-on collaborative network providing the tools to certify the supply chain and allow everyone to be accountable, make responsible decisions and improve efficiency.\nTAG TrustNet achieves this by automating the reconciliation of data across the supply chain and recording it in an immutable shared ledger as Shared Truth: a unified record for every single ad running through the supply chain made available in near real-time.\nWith Shared Truth, TAG TrustNet enables what can be defined as Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles:\n Know your business partners: every record can be tracked back to the legal entities that are part of a transaction Know their business practices: every record gets cross-checked and verified based on financial and qualitative metrics Make timely informed business decisions: every record gets reconciled and can be acted on in near real-time  As an always-on solution, TAG TrustNet sets a major industry milestone:\n For the industry as a whole by allowing everyone to act responsibly by conducting business transactions only with identified business partners; For advertisers and agencies by increasing cost efficiency and ad effectiveness, resulting in improved brand safety and ad spend productivity; For intermediaries and publishers by getting the opportunity to access to a larger share of ad spend as identified business partners agreeing to share impression data; and For all members by reducing operating costs over the automation of data reconciliation in a data secure and private context.  Accessing TAG TrustNet is a free and easy process. Members sign a membership agreement, get verified as an existing legal business entity, get identified by a tracking ID and agree to share their impression data with their business partners through TAG TrustNet based on member requirements. In a second step, after signing a licensing agreement, a dedicated network node gets activated over which data can be imported, shared and exported. Access to data remains at all times under the control of the data owner.\nTAG TrustNet’s objective is for the entire digital advertising industry to adopt and implement the 3 principles of Responsible Advertising by becoming members and leveraging TAG TrustNet to shape a responsible future for our industry.\nThe time for TRUST is now! </p><p></p>",

							value: "Supply Chain Report",
							label: "<p> The Supply Chain Report is only available in advertiser and agency nodes.\n The Supply Chain Report provides a great way to see how well your entire supply chain is meeting any number of your important metrics. The following information is provided in this section:\n Supply Chain Report Overview Qualified impression Other Ad Effectiveness Metrics Cost Efficiency Metrics   Supply Chain Report Overview\nSupply Chain Vendor Types This report uses a Sankey diagram to show the inventory flowing from the publishers on the right all the way to the ad server to the left. Wider lines between the vendor types indicate a greater volume or spend. The four thick vertical lines that are evenly spaced across the report show (from left to right) the ad server(s), DSP(s), exchanges\/SSPs, and Publishers (see below).\nIn addition, there is a key in the lower left of the diagram. This key shows how well the inventory (represented by the horizontal lines between the different supply chain vendors) meet the selected metric based on the color of the line. The color at the top of this key indicates the inventory met the highest level of the selected metric.\nData About the Inventory Between Vendor Types If you hover over the lines that appear between the different vendor types, you will see data about the inventory that is flowing between them. In the example below, the person has hovered over the line between the DSP and the Google AdX exchange–resulting in a tooltips box appearing that provides information specifically about the inventory from Google AdX that the DSP has purchased.\nTAG Certifications You can also see which vendors in your supply chain are certified for any of the four TAG programs (Brand Safey Certified, Certified Against Fraud, Certified Against Malware, and Certified Against Piracy). In the example below, Certified Against Fraud has been selected. The vendors whose name or column\/box are black indicate that they are currently enrolled in this program, and the ones in red are not. Note: the screen below is used just for illustrative purposes and does not indicate the actual status of these companies.\nAvailable Metrics As you can see from the image below there are a number of metrics available in the Supply Chain Report to choose from. You can find definitions for all metrics in the Glossary.\nUsing the Supply Chain Report Qualified Impression\nThe objective of having qualified impression or ad spend is to have a single metric that you can use to measure overall ad effectiveness. It is suggested by TAG TrustNet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency.\nIn TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and Ad Verification tool), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the Ad Verification tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request, and can be based on any combination of the metrics that appear within the Supply Chain Report.\nOther Ad Effectiveness Metrics\nThere are a number of other metrics in the Supply Chain Report that allow you to assess your ad effectiveness by answering the following questions:\n Was the impression matched across the log files received from different supply chain vendor types (ad server, Ad Verification, DSP, and Exchange\/SSP)? Was the timestamp of the impression that was recorded in the log files of the ad server, Ad Verification, and DSP platforms within 1 minute? Was the impression recorded only once by both the DSP and exchange? Was the same domain recorded by the Ad Verification tool and DSP for the impression? If the domains match this indicates that there was unlikely to be any domain spoofing. Did the exchange\/SSP purchase the impression directly from the publisher? Does the publisher have an ads.txt file for that impression? Does the exchange\/SSP have an sellers.json file for that impression? Is the publisher ID in the log file from the exchange\/SSP consistent with what is stated in both the ads.txt and sellers.json file? Is the entire supply chain TAG Certified Against Fraud? Is the entire supply chain TAG Brand Safety Certified? Does the impression meet any number of the standard Ad Verification tool criteria (Measureable, Brand Safe, non-IVT, Viewable, etc.)  Cost Efficency Metrics\nThere are a number of metrics in the Supply Chain Report that allow you to assess your cost efficiency by answering the following questions:\n Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data with the impression? Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data, along with the clearing price with the impression? What percent of the ad spend went directly to the publisher for the impression?   </p><p></p>",

This section will describe these options, which include two filters in the top of the screen (just below the date selector), Supply Source and Exchange or Domain. These are located within the blue oval in the screen shot above.\nSupply Source In this filter you have the following options:\n Domains: this will list all of the domains and their corresponding metrics, with no exchange information. Exchanges: this will list all of the exchanges and their corresponding metrics, with no domain information. Exchange and Domains: this will sort the data first by exchange, and then for each exchange list the domains whose inventory was purchased from that exchange.  Exchange or Domain This field will allow you to filter the data in this report to a specific exchange or domain.\nIssues to be aware of for this Report  Verified by TAG column: this status should almost always be known for publishers or exchanges that are certified for one of the TAG programs (such as Brand Safety Certified or Certified Against Fraud). Publishers who are only Verified by TAG may not appear in this report as verified as there are limitations in the data to show this.  </p><p></p>",

							value: "User Accounts Admin",
							label: "<p> The capabilities described below apply to all node types (except where noted).\n This documentation will provide information on how user accounts are created, managed, and activated\/inactivated, as well as providing details on the access options for accounts.\nRequesting a user account Every company who has a node on TAG TrustNet will have one person who can create user accounts for all users in that node (the Node User Administrator). If a new user account is required, the person who is the Node User Administrator for the node at that company should be contacted to set it up. The information that will be needed to set up a new account is:\n First and last name Email address Type of role. See below for the types of roles available. Country restrictions (optional) (advertiser and agency nodes only) Advertiser restrictions (optional) (agency nodes only)  If you don\u0026rsquo;t know who the Node User Administrator is for your company, please contact us at support@tagtrust.net.\nCreating a user account For Node User Administrators, here is how you create a new user account:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. On the top-right of the screen below, click on the \u002b NEW USER button. Enter the user name (first and last) and the email address. Select the user role (see below for a description for each one). Advertiser and agency nodes only: Review the Countries setting to see if it is correct Agency nodes only: If one or more countries have been selected, and if the Business Metrics Viewer role has been selected, review the Restrict by Advertisers field to make sure it is correct. See below for more details. Click on the Create User button on the bottom of the screen.  Once this last step is completed the user will automatically receive an email with a link to set the password for their new account. This email will include all information needed to log into the account including the following:\n the login URL the node name the user\u0026rsquo;s account name (which is the user\u0026rsquo;s email address)  This email will be sent from TAG TrustNet and the subject will be New TAG TrustNet Account.\nSettings for user accounts The following describes in more detail the settings for setting-up user accounts.\nUser Roles  Node User Administrator: This role is able to create new accounts for users in the node, as well as view all screens for all countries (for advertiser and agency nodes) and all advertisers (for agency nodes). This role can also create user accounts that can be Node User Administrators. Business Metrics Viewer (advertiser or agency node only): The access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Dashboard and Insights options in the top navigation bar. Data Manager:  for advertiser and agency nodes, the access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Node Health option in the top navigation bar. for all ad server, Ad Verification tool, DSP, Exchange\/SSP, and Publisher nodes the access for this role will be limited to the Node option in the top navigation bar.    If the Node User Administrator has been selected, no other roles can be selected (since the Node User Administrator can view all screens that are available to the other roles). The other two roles can be selected in any combination (based on their availability).\nCountries (advertiser and agency nodes only) This will allow users who have been assigned the Business Metrics Viewer role to have their access to be restricted to one or more countries. This setting does not impact the screens or data available to the Data Manager role.\nAdvertiser Restriction (agency node only) When the Business Metrics Viewer role is selected, and at least one country has been selected, the access for a user can be restricted to one or more advertisers. This setting will impact all screens that the Business Metrics Viewer has access to (for details on these screens, see User Roles above).\nMaking an account active or inactive The user\u0026rsquo;s account can be changed to be active or inactive by the is active control. If it is inactive the user is not allowed to login to their TAG TrustNet node. Accounts are not allowed to be deleted in order to maintain user data integrity.\nResetting a password If a user has forgotten their password or has been locked out of their account after 3 failed logins, the Node User Adminstrator should follow these steps to reset the password:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. Select the All users view. Find the row that has the account that needs the password reset. On the far right of that row there is an icon with three dots. Click it and select \u0026ldquo;Reset Password\u0026rdquo; Click the link Send Link by Email and an email will automatically be sent to the user to reset their password (the email will be sent from TAG TrustNet and the subject will be Reset Password). Alternatively you can send this manually by copying the link in the dialog window.  Other Account Information Time-out If a users account is inactive for 30 minutes the user will need to login again.\n3 Failed Logins If a user has tried unsuccessfully to login 3 times, the account will be locked. The only way the user can get access to their account is to have their password reset by the Node User Administrator. Instructions on how to do this are above (see Resetting a password).\n2-Factor Authentication If you want 2-Factor authentication enabled for your account please contact TAG TrustNet support. Once enabled it will be required for every user login. It supports both the Google and Microsoft authentication applications (but only one of these per node)\n</p><p>access, login, log-in</p>",
