Qualified Qualified impressions are impressions that meet a set of requirements to measure ad effectiveness. TAG TrustNet enables members to define their own requirements and to evaluate data reconciled across the supply chain against them. TAG TrustNet recommends defining qualified impression requirements based on ad quality, supply chain transparency and data consistency metrics. In TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same.   Qualified Viewable Ad spend or impressions that are both qualified (see Qualified above) AND viewable.

Licensee should configure all advertising tags for Ad servers and Content Verification Providers according to instructions provided by them or by Fiducia to correctly populate DSP Impression ID Passthrough data fields in their log files. Failure to do so will result in limited visibility of advertising delivery data in TAG TrustNet Node Manager and Supply Chain Monitor.  Log Level Data Accessibility Requirements\n Licensee should make sure that access for Ad Servers, Content Verification Providers and DSPs log level impression data for all Licensee authorised DSP seats IDs is provided to Fiducia or configured in Licensee’s TAG TrustNet Node Manager within timings set out in the License Agreement. (Optional) Licensee should make sure that complete access for SSPs log level impression data for all Licensee authorised DSP seats IDs is provided to Fiducia or configured in Licensee’s TAG TrustNet Node Manager within timings set out in the License Agreement. If Ad Server, Content Verification Provider, DSP or SSP provider has implemented Log Level Ingestion Automation as defined in TAG TrustNet Requirements for each respective vendor type, then Licensee can request activation of data access for Licensee’s TAG TrustNet Node via simplified process directly from vendor. For every vendor log level data files should be provided with comprehensive documentation with detailed descriptions of all data fields provided, required data dictionaries. Impression events should be reported in compliance industry guidelines, e.g. IAB begin to render:  Desktop Display Impression Measurement Guidelines-US Digital Video Impression Measurement Guidelines 1.1 Mobile In-App Measurement Guidelines (MMTF Final v1.1)   For impressions where SSP log level impression data is not accessible, metrics on SSP\/Exchange cost breakdown and supply path in the Supply Chain Monitor will be unavailable.

							value: "Supply Chain Monitor",
							label: "<p> The Supply Chain Monitor is only available in advertiser and agency nodes.\n The Supply Chain Monitor provides a great way to see how well your entire supply chain is meeting any number of your important metrics. The following information is provided in this section:\n Supply Chain Monitor Overview Qualified impression Other Ad Effectiveness Metrics Cost Efficiency Metrics   Supply Chain Monitor Overview\nSupply Chain Vendor Types This report uses a Sankey diagram to show the inventory flowing from the publishers on the right all the way to the ad server to the left. Wider lines between the vendor types indicate a greater volume or spend. The four thick vertical lines that are evenly spaced across the report show (from left to right) the ad server(s), DSP(s), exchanges\/SSPs, and Publishers (see below).\nIn addition, there is a key in the lower left of the diagram. This key shows how well the inventory (represented by the horizontal lines between the different supply chain vendors) meet the selected metric based on the color of the line. The color at the top of this key indicates the inventory met the highest level of the selected metric.\nData About the Inventory Between Vendor Types If you hover over the lines that appear between the different vendor types, you will see data about the inventory that is flowing between them. In the example below, the person has hovered over the line between the DSP and the Google AdX exchange–resulting in a tooltips box appearing that provides information specifically about the inventory from Google AdX that the DSP has purchased.\nTAG Certifications You can also see which vendors in your supply chain are certified for any of the four TAG programs (Brand Safey Certified, Certified Against Fraud, Certified Against Malware, and Certified Against Piracy). In the example below, Certified Against Fraud has been selected. The vendors whose name or column\/box are black indicate that they are currently enrolled in this program, and the ones in red are not. Note: the screen below is used just for illustrative purposes and does not indicate the actual status of these companies.\nAvailable Metrics As you can see from the image below there are a number of metrics available in the Supply Chain Monitor to choose from. You can find definitions for all metrics in the Glossary.\nUsing the Supply Chain Monitor Qualified Impression\nThe objective of having qualified impression or ad spend is to have a single metric that you can use to measure overall ad effectiveness. It is suggested by TAG TrustNet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency.\nIn TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request, and can be based on any combination of the metrics that appear within the Supply Chain Monitor.\nOther Ad Effectiveness Metrics\nThere are a number of other metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your ad effectiveness by answering the following questions:\n Was the impression matched across the log files received from different supply chain vendor types (ad server, CV, DSP, and Exchange\/SSP)? Was the timestamp of the impression that was recorded in the log files of the ad server, CV, and DSP platforms within 1 minute? Was the impression recorded only once by both the DSP and SSP? Was the same domain recorded by the CV tool and DSP for the impression? If the domains match this indicates that there was unlikely to be any domain spoofing. Did the exchange\/SSP purchase the impression directly from the publisher? Does the publisher have an ads.txt file for that impression? Does the exchange\/SSP have an sellers.json file for that impression? Is the publisher ID in the log file from the exchange\/SSP consistent with what is stated in both the ads.txt and sellers.json file? Is the entire supply chain TAG Certified Against Fraud? Is the entire supply chain TAG Brand Safety Certified? Does the impression meet any number of the standard CV tool criteria (Measureable, Brand Safe, non-IVT, Viewable, etc.)  Cost Efficency Metrics\nThere are a number of metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your cost efficiency by answering the following questions:\n Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data with the impression? Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data, along with the clearing price with the impression? What percent of the ad spend went directly to the publisher for the impression?   </p><p></p>",

							label: "<p> responsible advertising for a responsible industry Over the last decade Real-Time Bidding (RTB) created massive efficiency for the digital advertising marketplace in opening large volumes of inventory, driving down prices and creating the opportunity for smaller sites and apps to thrive. Today it has become a large $200B market that continues to grow at an accelerated pace with a supply chain that remains complex, fragmented, partly opaque and could be even more efficient. In a context where decisions are increasingly made by technology, traditional processes do not apply and there is a need to bring a technological solution to what is essentially a technological problem.\nAs a global cross-industry initiative, TAG TrustNet is taking the industry to the next level as an always-on collaborative network providing the tools to certify the supply chain and allow everyone to be accountable, make responsible decisions and improve efficiency.\nTAG TrustNet achieves this by automating the reconciliation of data across the supply chain and recording it in an immutable shared ledger as Shared Truth: a unified record for every single ad running through the supply chain made available in near real-time.\nWith Shared Truth, TAG TrustNet enables what can be defined as Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles:\n Know your business partners: every record can be tracked back to the legal entities that are part of a transaction Know their business practices: every record gets cross-checked and verified based on financial and qualitative metrics Make timely informed business decisions: every record gets reconciled and can be acted on in near real-time  As an always-on solution, TAG TrustNet sets a major industry milestone:\n For the industry as a whole by allowing everyone to act responsibly by conducting business transactions only with identified business partners; For advertisers and agencies by increasing cost efficiency and ad effectiveness, resulting in improved brand safety and ad spend productivity; For intermediaries and publishers by getting the opportunity to access to a larger share of ad spend as identified business partners agreeing to share impression data; and For all members by reducing operating costs over the automation of data reconciliation in a data secure and private context.  Accessing TAG TrustNet is a free and easy process. Members sign a membership agreement, get verified as an existing legal business entity, get identified by a tracking ID and agree to share their impression data with their business partners through TAG TrustNet based on member requirements. In a second step, after signing a licensing agreement, a dedicated network node gets activated over which data can be imported, shared and exported. Access to data remains at all times under the control of the data owner.\nTAG TrustNet’s objective is for the entire digital advertising industry to adopt and implement the 3 principles of Responsible Advertising by becoming members and leveraging TAG TrustNet to shape a responsible future for our industry.\nThe time for TRUST is now! </p><p></p>",

							label: "<p>Benefits Why should I participate?    TAG TrustNet is a cross-industry network running an always-on platform making the industry more accountable, responsible, and efficient. The platform was validated with major brands, agencies and tech vendors over a 2-year pilot and is positioned to contribute to the continued growth of the industry by enabling Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles: know your business partners, know their business practices, make timely informed decisions. While providing accountability and compliance, TAG TrustNet is driving business value and efficiencies for network participants at a minimal cost compared to the benefits it generates.   What are the participant benefits relative to costs?    Based on a cost in a 1 to 2% range of the advertising spend depending on volume, the cost\/benefit ratio can reach a high multiple depending on how the reconciled data is used. The network provides a range of direct benefits, that can be enhanced over system integrations and applications.   Is a DLT network adding a layer of complexity?    DLT is a breakthrough in various industries as a technology solution taking away the complexities and inefficiencies of supply chains. It allows companies to share and reconcile transaction data among trusted business partners in line with their contractual agreements in a secure and trusted collaborative environment. It most notably takes away the need for lots of different integrations between different organisations, simplifies legal agreements among participants, and allows to automate them over smart contracts. Compliance information becomes readily available and always-on reporting contributes to the reduction of expensive reconciliation and auditing.   If I already get log files from other supply chain participants, why would I need this?    Building log file integrations with every partner in the ecosystem is expensive. Maintaining them when they are up and running is also expensive because it comes with a substantial commitment to keep technology up to date: over time partners will change their technology, naming conventions, access settings or specifications. With TAG TrustNet only one integration is required to get access to the logs of every other network member. Moreover, log file data can be downloaded already pre-reconciled according to defined rules and used for automated business agreement management. For these reasons, for most companies DLT will be a cheaper, more efficient way to get access log files than other methods.   Does the industry need common log file standards if it has DLT?    Log files reconciliation requires log file data provided by various individual supply chain participants to be consistent. One way to address this question is to define detailed standards for log file formats, data fields naming conventions, taxonomies and meanings. To come to an agreement on industry logging standards is taking time and will require significant investments from adtech vendors to adjust their logging systems.\nThe other approach is to write log file data to the TAG TrustNet DLT network, where it is automatically harmonised to a common network format at the moment it is written. This approach requires less investments from ad-tech vendors, as it allows to use any formats, taxonomies and naming conventions as long as they can be harmonised to a common format. The only standard required to avoid any ambiguity is to define the meaning of data fields. With this approach the log files reconciliation functionality may be supported by the industry much faster with minimal changes required from ad-tech vendors.\n   How does TAG TrustNet compliment the use of Content Verfication (CV) providers?    In general, CV Providers deliver ad effectiveness impression data, blocking and pre-bid tools. They do not cover cost efficiency (supply chain costs), ad delivery\/reconciliation, and compliance to industry standards. By incorporating your CV data within TAG TrustNet you are able to:\nConfirm what site and application ads actually appeared on. Matched log-level data from the DSP, SSP, ad server and CV company are used to confirm the domain that was recorded for an impression from each platform. If there are differences this can help identify technical problems, misplacement, and domain spoofing.\nMatching cost data from the DSP and SSP means you can analyse standard verification metrics leading to better business decisions.\nTAG TrustNet allows you to evaluate how industry standards (ads.txt and sellers.json) and certifications (TAG) get implemented in a single place to improve brand safety, and reduce fraud, malware and piracy.\nTAG TrustNet reconciles supply chain participants data producing a single shared truth that can be used for discrepancy management, managing partner and tag deployments and improving operational efficiency.\n   What does TAG TrustNet deliver for ads.txt that you cannot get from any other solution?    There is no other solution available today that allows to cross-verify impression log files of ads coming from multiple supply chain data sources. TAG TrustNet allows to compare the ads.txt file from a publisher, the sellers.json file from an exchange, and the impression log file from the SSP to ensure these files exist and consistently describe their relationship and the seller\/buyer identifiers with what appears in the log file.   Compliance What has TAG TrustNet done to comply with data protection laws?    TAG TrustNet does not allow its members to process Personal Data or otherwise link data within the TAG TrustNet with other data held by a participant to create Personal Data. Every TAG TrustNet member shall comply with TAG TrustNet Member Requirements, which state that log-level data provided for ingestion into TAG TrustNet shall not include any Personal Data and, as such, should fall outside of the scope of data protection laws, including, without limitation, the GDPR and the CCPA. All Personal Data, and any data fields which represent “pseudonymous data,” shall be removed before the underlying dataset is ingested into TAG TrustNet.  “Personal Data” means any information defined as “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or other similar term under applicable data protection laws.   While impression timestamps and oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs that are ingested into TAG TrustNet might be considered “pseudonymous data” in some circumstances, it is “anonymous data” in this case because:\n\u0026ndash; It is not possible for Fiducia, as a platform provider for TAG TrustNet, to use this data to identify an individual and;\n\u0026ndash; TAG TrustNet obfuscates these data fields when they are exported to reasonably prevent anyone from linking TAG TrustNet impression records to an individual (see below for more details). In addition to the above, Fiducia, as a platform provider, takes the following steps to reduce risks of re-identifiability of data ingested by, or exported from, TAG TrustNet, so as to achieve the standards of anonymization under applicable data protection laws (such as by not allowing re-identification via the “means reasonably likely to be used” by a third party, per the GDPR standard for determining whether data is “identifiable”):\n\u0026ndash; For all supported data sources, the TAG TrustNet Node Data Connectors filter any data fields that represent Personal Data from processing in the TAG TrustNet. Only data fields outlined in TAG TrustNet Member Requirements are ingested to by TAG TrustNet for processing.\n\u0026ndash; When data is exported by TAG TrustNet Members to external databases, the TAG TrustNet Node obfuscates oRTB Bid Request Impression ID, oRTB Bid Request ID, and Timestamp data fields as follows. oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs and oRTB Bid Request IDs are replaced with anonymous impression IDs, which cannot be linked back to original oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs or oRTB Bid Request IDs. Timestamps are rounded to 1-hour intervals.\n   General Information What is a distributed ledger?    It is a type of database which stores transaction records and is consensually shared, synchronized and accessible across multiple organisations, sites, institutions, or geographies. A distributed ledger stands in contrast to a centralized database, which is more prone to failures, cyber-attacks and fraud, as it is administered by a single organisation and therefore has a single point of failure.\n   What is distributed ledger technology or DLT?    The terms blockchain and DLT are often used interchangeably. Blockchain is a particular type of DLT which was popularized by Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the ledger of transactions is as a sequence of blocks of data linked together through cryptography. The name comes from the fact that the ‘blocks’ are ‘chained’ in this fashion.   What is a DLT network?    A DLT Network is a network of computers, called network nodes, which implement a distributed ledger by running specialised software and communication protocols to share, synchronise and access the ledger records. When a ledger update happens, these nodes apply a consensus mechanism to agree on the ordering of transaction records and whether they should be included. The consensus mechanism allows the ledger to be tamper resistant and immutable and containing only confirmed and validated transactions. Because the nodes contain identical replicas of ledger records, users of nodes know that “What you see is what I see” when they access the ledger.   What is a permissioned DLT network?    TAG TrustNet is a permissioned network, as opposed to unpermissioned networks like Bitcoin that are open to anyone. It is pemissioned in three ways: (a) the participants need to agree to the governance and control principles to participate to the network, (b) the participants need to be approved to become network members, (c) the participants need to comply with the network minimum requirements at all times.\n   What is a smart contract?    A smart contract is a computer program stored in a distributed ledger network wherein the outcome of any execution of the program is recorded on the distributed ledger. A smart contract might represent terms in a contract in law and create a legally enforceable obligation under the legislation of an applicable jurisdiction. Smart contracts allow organisations to automate their business relationships using software code with enforceability based on the distributed ledger records.   Governance Why should trade associations set up a DLT network?    To resolve the industry accountability problem – which in a technology driven industry essentially requires a technology solution – by implementing an always-on decentralised technology infrastructure able to reconcile impression data in the context of an industry network, to enforce measurable industry standards, certifications, and legal requirements on an ongoing basis. This cannot be achieved with centralised solutions controlled by individual entities but requires an industry-wide approach and trade associations are best placed to play that role.   How do the network requirements get enforced?    Requirements that are measurable over the impression log data provided to the platform get enforced over the DLT platform. Requirements that are not measurable will go through a traditional audit process.   How does the network fight fraud?    Any company joining the network needs to comply with minimum requirements to become a TAG TrustNet member allowed to use the network over a node. This includes the need to get identified as a legitimate legal entity and to be issued a tracking TAG-ID. The requirements define the data that needs to be included in the data feeds of providers. The reconciliation of this data among supply chain participants allows a company to detect discrepancies between the different data sets providing a signal for potential fraud. Under certain conditions, a company may be prevented from participating to transactions should the ledger provide evidence that it does not comply with network requirements at all times.   Who gets access to the data?    A consent framework is activated as part of the network functionality. Depending on the case, access to data may require one or more parties to provide their consents. As all consents can easily be provided by all parties over their nodes this process is easily managed using the network functionality. Consents are automatically enforced and data providers remain in control of access as they voluntarily can decide whether to report data or not.   Who can build applications?    Anyone in the industry can contribute to the development of the network application ecosystem using the platform API providing access to the distributed ledger.   Why is wide industry adoption important?    For TAG TrustNet to deliver its full benefits to its members it has to be widely adopted across the industry as a joint collaborative effort to implement a “new standard” in the way to conduct business in a more accountable, responsible, sustainable and efficient way. The network is helping to create a fair and open marketplace based on accountability with the enforcement of self-defined rules that all participants across the supply chain agree to implement consistently at all times.   Membership for Intermediaries and Publishers What is the process to join TAG TrustNet as an intermediary or publisher?    For intermediaries (such as ad servers, CVs, DSPs, and Exchanges\/SSPs) and publishers here is a summary of the process to join:\n Become a TAG Member and be verified as a legitimate legal entity with a TAG ID Agree to the network requirements and sign the TAG TrustNet Membership Agreement Sign the TAG TrustNet Licensing \u0026amp; Service Level Agreement Complete the Node and Data Assessment Form Get a Data Connector built and approved Get a Network Node set-up allowing to import and share data with other network members Set up ongoing data feed(s) based on advertiser requests     What does is the cost to join as an intermediary or publisher    For TAG members with a TAG ID the TAG TrustNet membership is free. To have an active node on the network to share data, the only cost is a one-time activation fee of $5k, $10k or $15k depending on annual digital advertising revenue. The activation fee is waived for all companies joining TAG TrustNet on or before December 31, 2021.   How do I send data to TAG TrustNet?    Data is to be sent to the network using standard delivery mechanisms. It usually gets usually delivery to a cloud bucket (Amazon s3, Google GCP) or accessed via SnowFlake or other access points. As part of the data integration process, members are required to provide an example or a live data feed which will be used to create a TAG TrustNet Network Adaptor that will automatically ingest, match and harmonise data within the network.   Why do I need to provide logs?    Log-level data must be provided by all TAG TrustNet Members for their impression data to be deterministically matched across supply chains.   How is my data used by the network?    Member data is ingested into the network and matched with impressions data from other network members sharing the same identifier that is activated at the request of advertisers. The matched data is recorded in the distributed ledger and (i) shared with the advertiser over the TAG TrustNet Supply Chain Monitor and (ii) included in the reconciled data that can get exported by advertisers into their own systems.   What control do I have over my data?    A consent framework is part of the network functionality. Access to data may require one or more parties to provide consent and all consents are automatically enforced within the network infrastructure. The data provider always remains in control of data access.   Technical Questions What is the Reconciliation SDK?    The Reconciliation SDK (software development kit) is a tool developed by Fiducia that can be installed on publisher sites and applications. It creates a log file record ID map when an ad is requested that can then be shared with every supply chain participant. With this ID map, log files of various supply chain participants can all be matched deterministically line to line. The SDK is preserving consumer privacy and cannot be used for consumer tracking.   Does TAG TrustNet have any additional tag requirements for advertisers or agencies?    TAG TrustNet uses existing log files that supply chain partners can already provide. The only time an additional tag is needed is when the TAG Reconciliation Service is deployed. Whether or not this is needed gets determined as part of the initial supply chain mapping exercise.   </p>",
