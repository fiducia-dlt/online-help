The goals may include target audience, brand safety, fraud, and other criteria.   Ad Spend The total amount of money spent to purchase impressions programmatically, which includes both delivery costs and media spend.   Ad Spend Productivity A measurement of buying ads using the least amount of ad spend to meet the goals of a campaign. This measure combines both ad effectiveness and cost efficiency   Ad Spend received by Publisher The percent of the ad spend that is received by the publisher.   Ads.txt implemented Ad spend or impressions where the publisher has an ads.txt or app-ads.txt file.   Ads.txt matches SSP log file The sellers ID (and seller type if available) in the SSP log file matches what is in the publishers ads.txt file.   Allowed Ad spend or impressions meeting the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign and with no violations (blocks for inappropriate content, IVT, or App\/Site\/Language. (DoubleVerify only)   Brand safe Ad spend or impressions determined to be brand safe as determined by the CV tool.   Brand safe and Non-IVT Ad spend or impressions determined to be both brand safe and non-IVT as determined by the CV tool.   Consistency of ads.txt, sellers.json, and log-level data The seller ID from the SSP log file matches the seller ID (also called the Publisher’s Account ID) in the publishers ads.txt or app-ads.txt file AND the seller ID in the sellers.json file   Cost difference between DSP and Exchange The DSP media costs minus the SSP recorded winning price.   Cost Efficiency A measurement of how successfully ads are being purchased using the least amount of the ad spend.   Delivery Costs The amount of ad spend paid for impressions that includes everything except the payment to the publisher. Delivery costs typically includes platform fees paid to intermediaries (including ad servers, DSPs and SSPs) and data.   Exchange works with publisher directly Ad spend or impressions where the exchange works with the publisher directly based on its log file records and sellers.json data, along with the publishers ads.txt or app-ads.txt file   Financial data provided by DSP and Exchange Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost   Financial data provided by DSP and Exchange with matching impression costs Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost and clearing price records match   Live Compliance Performing compliance checks based on impression log-level data in near real-time of a supply chain to industry regulations, standards, and certifications.   Live Reconciliation Harmonizing, matching, and recording impression delivery log records across a supply chain in near real-time.   Matched by ad server, CV tool, and DSP Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, CV tool, and DSP   Matched by ad server, CV tool, DSP, and Exchange (beta) Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, CV tool, DSP, and exchange   Matched by CV tool Ad spend or impressions that have been recorded by both the CV tool and DSP.   Matched publisher domain Ad spend or impressions where the ad server, CV tool, DSP (and SSP data if available) all recorded the same domain.   Matched timestamps Ad spend or impressions that had timestamps recorded within 1 minute for the ad server, CV tool, and DSP.   Measurable Ad spend or impressions were able to be measured for viewability as determined by the CV tool.   Media Spend The amount of ad spend that goes to the publisher.   Monitored Ad spend or impressions where the DoubleVerify monitoring services were applied, were not blocked and had no violations from DoubleVerify. (DoubleVerify only)   Node Manager The TAG TrustNet product that members log into to configure their node, manage users, manage data and access the Supply Chain monitor or other network functionalities.   Non-Blocked Requests Ad spend or impressions where the requests were not blocked because they met the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign. (DoubleVerify only)   Non-IVT Ad Spend or impression is determined to be delivered to a person as determined by the CV tool.   Qualified Qualified impressions are impressions that meet a set of requirements to measure ad effectiveness. TAG TrustNet enables members to define their own requirements and to evaluate data reconciled across the supply chain against them. TAG TrustNet recommends defining qualified impression requirements based on ad quality, supply chain transparency and data consistency metrics. In TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same.   Qualified Viewable Ad spend or impressions that are both qualified (see Qualified above) AND viewable.   Sellers.json implemented Ad spend or impressions where the exchange or SSP has a sellers.json file.   Supply Chain is TAG BSC Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Brand Safety Certified.   Supply Chain is TAG CAF Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Certified Against Fraud.   Supply Chain Monitor The TAG TrustNet report for an agency or advertiser that uses a Sankey diagram to show data about the flow of inventory across programmatic participants, from the ad server to the publishers.   Unduplicated impressions Ad spend or impressions where the impressions were reported as unique by the DSP.   Viewable according to CV Tool Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the CV tool being used.   Viewable according to DSP or Ad Server Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the DSP or Ad Server being used. If viewability data is available from both systems the DSP data will be used.    </p><p></p>",

							label: "<p> responsible advertising for a responsible industry Over the last decade Real-Time Bidding (RTB) created massive efficiency for the digital advertising marketplace in opening large volumes of inventory, driving down prices and creating the opportunity for smaller sites and apps to thrive. Today it has become a large $200B market that continues to grow at an accelerated pace with a supply chain that remains complex, fragmented, partly opaque and could be even more efficient. In a context where decisions are increasingly made by technology, traditional processes do not apply and there is a need to bring a technological solution to what is essentially a technological problem.\nAs a global cross-industry initiative, TAG TrustNet is taking the industry to the next level as an always-on collaborative network providing the tools to certify the supply chain and allow everyone to be accountable, make responsible decisions and improve efficiency.\nTAG TrustNet achieves this by automating the reconciliation of data across the supply chain and recording it in an immutable shared ledger as Shared Truth: a unified record for every single ad running through the supply chain made available in near real-time.\nWith Shared Truth, TAG TrustNet enables what can be defined as Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles:\n Know your business partners: every record can be tracked back to the legal entities that are part of a transaction Know their business practices: every record gets cross-checked and verified based on financial and qualitative metrics Make timely informed business decisions: every record gets reconciled and can be acted on in near real-time  As an always-on solution, TAG TrustNet sets a major industry milestone:\n For the industry as a whole by allowing everyone to act responsibly by conducting business transactions only with identified business partners; For advertisers and agencies by increasing cost efficiency and ad effectiveness, resulting in improved brand safety and ad spend productivity; For intermediaries and publishers by getting the opportunity to access to a larger share of ad spend as identified business partners agreeing to share impression data; and For all members by reducing operating costs over the automation of data reconciliation in a data secure and private context.  Accessing TAG TrustNet is a free and easy process. Members sign a membership agreement, get verified as an existing legal business entity, get identified by a tracking ID and agree to share their impression data with their business partners through TAG TrustNet based on member requirements. In a second step, after signing a licensing agreement, a dedicated network node gets activated over which data can be imported, shared and exported. Access to data remains at all times under the control of the data owner.\nTAG TrustNet’s objective is for the entire digital advertising industry to adopt and implement the 3 principles of Responsible Advertising by becoming members and leveraging TAG TrustNet to shape a responsible future for our industry.\nThe time for TRUST is now! </p><p></p>",

							value: "Dashboard",
							label: "<p> The Dashboard screen is only available on advertiser or agency nodes.\n The purpose of the dashboard is to allow you to easily see the most critical metrics that are tracked by TAG TrustNet everytime you login. For most metrics you have the option to set a goal so that you can see how well these metrics are doing against your goals.\nThe dashboard is comprised of a number of individual panels showing metrics and goals called widgets. These widgets are grouped into two categories, Ad Effectiveness and Cost Efficiency. The widgets can be added, changed, and deleted, in order to customize the dashboard for your account. The following provides information about how to make these changes.\nTime Period The time period for data that is used for the entire dashboard is set at the upper left of the dashboard. You can set this to any time period that you want and this setting will be used when you login in the future.\nChange Existing Widgets Modify Existing Widgets To change the settings for an existing widget:\n Within the widget that you want to change, click on the icon in the top-right corner with the three vertical dots. Select Edit Make the desired changes Click the Save Widget button.  Move Existing Widgets You can easily change the position of widgets on the dashboard by doing the following:\n Hover over the widget that you want to move. A small grid of six dots will appear to the left of the widget name. Click (and hold) on top of the dots and move the widget to the desired location. Once the widget is at the desire location release the mouse button.  Note: You are not allowed to move widgets to different categories (for example from Ad Effectiveness to Cost Efficiency, or vice-versa).\nDelete Existing Widgets In order to delete a widget follow these steps:\n Within the widget that you want to change, click on the icon in the top-right corner with the three vertical dots. Select Remove.  Note: once widgets are removed they cannot be restored (in otherwords, you cannot \u0026ldquo;undo\u0026rdquo; this action). If you accidentally remove a widget you can simply add it back (see Add New Widgets immediately below).\nAdd New Widgets To add a widget follow these steps:\n At the top-right of the dashboard screen click on the \u002b Add Widget button. Select whether you want it to be a a Goal Widget or Over Time widget. As you select these options you can see a preview of what they will look like to the right. Select the metric that you want to use from the drop-down menu. Select whether you want to use Ad Spend or Impressions as the basis for the metrics. Select whether you want to show the metric value or a % in the widget (the preview will show how these options will be displayed) Choose a goal to be used to measure the performance of the metric. This is optional. Click the Add Widget button.  Once the widget is created you can move it to the desired location in the dashboard. Please refer to Move Existing Widgets above.\nNote: most, but not all settings can be changed once you have created a widget. Once you have selected a widget to be a Goal Widget or Over Time widget you cannot change it to be the other type once you select Add Widget. If you want to make this change your only option is to delete the widget and create another one.\n</p><p></p>",

The following information is provided in this section:\n Supply Chain Monitor Overview Qualified impression Other Ad Effectiveness Metrics Cost Efficiency Metrics   Supply Chain Monitor Overview\nSupply Chain Vendor Types This report uses a Sankey diagram to show the inventory flowing from the publishers on the right all the way to the ad server to the left. Wider lines between the vendor types indicate a greater volume or spend. The four thick vertical lines that are evenly spaced across the report show (from left to right) the ad server(s), DSP(s), exchanges\/SSPs, and Publishers (see below).\nIn addition, there is a key in the lower left of the diagram. This key shows how well the inventory (represented by the horizontal lines between the different supply chain vendors) meet the selected metric based on the color of the line. The color at the top of this key indicates the inventory met the highest level of the selected metric.\nData About the Inventory Between Vendor Types If you hover over the lines that appear between the different vendor types, you will see data about the inventory that is flowing between them. In the example below, the person has hovered over the line between the DSP and the Google AdX exchange–resulting in a tooltips box appearing that provides information specifically about the inventory from Google AdX that the DSP has purchased.\nTAG Certifications You can also see which vendors in your supply chain are certified for any of the four TAG programs (Brand Safey Certified, Certified Against Fraud, Certified Against Malware, and Certified Against Piracy). In the example below, Certified Against Fraud has been selected. The vendors whose name or column\/box are black indicate that they are currently enrolled in this program, and the ones in red are not. Note: the screen below is used just for illustrative purposes and does not indicate the actual status of these companies.\nAvailable Metrics As you can see from the image below there are a number of metrics available in the Supply Chain Monitor to choose from. You can find definitions for all metrics in the Glossary.\nUsing the Supply Chain Monitor Qualified Impression\nThe objective of having qualified impression or ad spend is to have a single metric that you can use to measure overall ad effectiveness. It is suggested by TAG TrustNet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency.\nIn TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request, and can be based on any combination of the metrics that appear within the Supply Chain Monitor.\nOther Ad Effectiveness Metrics\nThere are a number of other metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your ad effectiveness by answering the following questions:\n Was the impression matched across the log files received from different supply chain vendor types (ad server, CV, DSP, and Exchange\/SSP)? Was the timestamp of the impression that was recorded in the log files of the ad server, CV, and DSP platforms within 1 minute? Was the impression recorded only once by both the DSP and SSP? Was the same domain recorded by the CV tool and DSP for the impression? If the domains match this indicates that there was unlikely to be any domain spoofing. Did the exchange\/SSP purchase the impression directly from the publisher? Does the publisher have an ads.txt file for that impression? Does the exchange\/SSP have an sellers.json file for that impression? Is the publisher ID in the log file from the exchange\/SSP consistent with what is stated in both the ads.txt and sellers.json file? Is the entire supply chain TAG Certified Against Fraud? Is the entire supply chain TAG Brand Safety Certified? Does the impression meet any number of the standard CV tool criteria (Measureable, Brand Safe, non-IVT, Viewable, etc.)  Cost Efficency Metrics\nThere are a number of metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your cost efficiency by answering the following questions:\n Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data with the impression? Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data, along with the clearing price with the impression? What percent of the ad spend went directly to the publisher for the impression?   </p><p></p>",

This data can then be exported to a CSV file so that it can be used in other platforms.\nFiltering Options It is important to highlight that the data above can be viewed with a few options. This section will describe these options, which include two filters in the top of the screen (just below the date selector), Supply Source and Exchange or Domain. These are located within the blue oval in the screen shot above.\nSupply Source In this filter you have the following options:\n Domains: this will list all of the domains and their corresponding metrics, with no exchange information. Exchanges: this will list all of the exchanges and their corresponding metrics, with no domain information. Exchange and Domains: this will sort the data first by exchange, and then for each exchange list the domains whose inventory was purchased from that exchange.  Exchange or Domain This field will allow you to filter the data in this report to a specific exchange or domain.\n</p><p></p>",

							value: "User Accounts Admin",
							label: "<p> The capabilities described below apply to all node types (except where noted).\n This documentation will provide information on how user accounts are created, managed, and activated\/inactivated, as well as providing details on the access options for accounts.\nRequesting a user account Every company who has a node on TAG TrustNet will have at least one person who can create user accounts for all users in that node (the Node User Administrator). If a new user account is required, the person who is the Node User Administrator(s) for the node at that company should be contacted to set it up. The information that will be needed to set up a new account is:\n First and last name Email address Type of role. See below for the types of roles available. Country restrictions (optional) (advertiser and agency nodes only) Advertiser restrictions (optional) (agency nodes only)  If you don\u0026rsquo;t know who the Node User Administrator is for your company, please contact us at support@tagtrust.net.\nCreating a user account For Node User Administrators, here is how you create a new user account:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. On the top-right of the screen below, click on the \u002b NEW USER button. Enter the user name (first and last) and the email address. Select the user role (see below for a description for each one). Advertiser and agency nodes only: Review the Countries setting to see if it is correct Agency nodes only: If one or more countries have been selected, and if the Business Metrics Viewer role has been selected, review the Restrict by Advertisers field to make sure it is correct. See below for more details. Click on the Create User button on the bottom of the screen.  Once this last step is completed the user will automatically receive an email with a link to set the password for their new account. This email will include all information needed to log into the account including the following:\n the login URL the node name the user\u0026rsquo;s account name (which is the user\u0026rsquo;s email address)  This email will be sent from TAG TrustNet and the subject will be New TAG TrustNet Account.\nSettings for user accounts The following describes in more detail the settings for setting-up user accounts.\nUser Roles  Node User Administrator: This role is able to create new accounts for users in the node, as well as view all screens for all countries (for advertiser and agency nodes) and all advertisers (for agency nodes). This role can also create user accounts that can be Node User Administrators. Business Metrics Viewer (advertiser or agency node only): The access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Dashboard and Insights options in the top navigation bar. Data Manager:  for advertiser and agency nodes, the access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Node Health option in the top navigation bar. for all ad server, CV, DSP, Exchange\/SSP, and Publisher nodes the access for this role will be limited to the Node option in the top navigation bar.    If the Node User Administrator has been selected, no other roles can be selected (since the Node User Administrator can view all screens that are available to the other roles). The other two roles can be selected in any combination (based on their availability).\nCountries (advertiser and agency nodes only) This will allow users who have been assigned the Business Metrics Viewer role to have their access to be restricted to one or more countries. This setting does not impact the screens or data available to the Data Manager role.\nAdvertiser Restriction (agency node only) When the Business Metrics Viewer role is selected, and at least one country has been selected, the access for a user can be restricted to one or more advertisers. This setting will impact all screens that the Business Metrics Viewer has access to (for details on these screens, see User Roles above).\nMaking an account active or inactive The user\u0026rsquo;s account can be changed to be active or inactive by the is active control. If it is inactive the user is not allowed to login to their TAG TrustNet node. Accounts are not allowed to be deleted in order to maintain user data integrity.\nResetting a password If a user has forgotten their password or has been locked out of their account after 3 failed logins, the Node User Adminstrator should follow these steps to reset the password:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. Select the All users view. Find the row that has the account that needs the password reset. On the far right of that row there is an icon with three dots. Click it and select \u0026ldquo;Reset Password\u0026rdquo; Click the link Send Link by Email and an email will automatically be sent to the user to reset their password (the email will be sent from TAG TrustNet and the subject will be Reset Password). Alternatively you can send this manually by copying the link in the dialog window.  Other Account Information Time-out If a users account is inactive for 30 minutes the user will need to login again.\n3 Failed Logins If a user has tried unsuccessfully to login 3 times, the account will be locked. The only way the user can get access to their account is to have their password reset by the Node User Administrator. Instructions on how to do this are above (see Resetting a password).\nMandatory Password Changes A node can be configured to require that all user passwords be changed every 60 days. Contact TAG TrustNet support to have this enabled.\n</p><p>access, login, log-in</p>",
