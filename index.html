							value: "Benchmark",
							label: "<p> The Benchmark is available to advertisers that either only have access to this screen or that have their own TAG TrustNet node.\n Sections of this on-line guide:\nOverview: A general overview of the purpose of the Benchmark.\nHow to Read Benchmark Graphs: Describes how to read the quartile and bubble graphs.\nBenchmark Sections: Details how to use the controls in the various sections of the Benchmark.\nSources of Data for Benchmark: Provides information on the sources of the data in the Benchmark, links to information about the methodology for generating the data, and where to get more information.\nOverview\nThe objectives of the benchmark are to allow you to:\n Analyze your programmatic supply chain using Log Level Data (LLD) combined with feeds from the Fiducia Data Exchange. Compare your data to the findings of the ANA Study and, every month, to the latest industry Benchmark. Use the TrueKPI framework to define and monitor your optimization roadmap to boost ad spend productivity.  This documentation will provide an overview of each section of the Benchmark and how you can get the most out of it.\nThere is a significant amount of help is built into this screen to help you better understand the information being presented. First, there are a number of visualizations of data on the right side of the screen in the Key Findings and Industry Benchmark sections. If you hover your mouse over these visualizations, you will get more information about how to read them and the meaning of the icons. Secondly, most of the metrics in this page have more information about them if you hover over the help icon (?) to the right of it.\n How to Read Benchmark Graphs\nThroughout this screen there are graphs presented. This section will help you better able to interpret the data in these graphs.\nQuartile Graphs\nThe metrics for each benchmark is based off the median for the industry. A median is the midpoint for a distribution of data—in this case there will be as many advertisers with a score above this point as below. The quartiles are based on the median as well. For example the first quartile will include the 25% of advertisers who have the lowest scores, the next quartile will include another 25% of advertisers with the next highest scores, etc.\nBecause the distribution of advertiser scores will vary for each metric, the size of the quartiles should be expected to change for each one.\nIn the example below, the median for this metric is 7.5%, which means that 50% of the advertiser scores are above this value and 50% are below. The lowest quartile range is 4.7-7.0%, which means 25% of the advertisers had a score in this range. Another 25% of advertisers had a score between 7.0-7.5%. The inverted triangle is the score for a particular advertiser.\nThe quartile graphs in this screen with multiple colors are for those metrics where it is generally agreed that there are better and worse scores. The graphs that are in blue are for metrics where it is not clear which scores are considered better or worse.\nBubble graph\nThere is a bubble graph presented at the end of the Benchmark in the TrueKPI Optimization Opportunity section. The bubbles in this graph represents clusters of inventories that were analyzed. The green bubbles are inventory that had a high percent of TrueImpressions and were purchased at a lower CPM. The red bubbles are inventory that had a low percent of TrueImpressions and were purchased at a higher CPM. The yellow bubbles represent inventory that was in a range that was close an average percent of TrueImpressions and were purchased in a price range that was close to an average CPM.\nBenchmark Sections\nKey Findings This section is meant to summarize the most important highlights in the Benchmark, including:\n Loss of Media Productivity: How much of your ad spend is on impressions that that do not meet the definition of a TrueImpression, and are usually non-measurable, non-viewable, and\/or are not viewed by people (also called Invalid Traffic or IVT). Transaction Costs: How much of your ad spend is going to fees and costs charged by your DSPs and SSPs. TrueKPI Opportunity: How much you can improve your ad spend productivity by using the TrueKPI Framework. Top 3 recommendations to improve your ad spend efficiency.  To get more information about the graphs in this section hover your mouse over them.\nDistribution of Display Ad Spend This section provides a profile of your inventory that was included in this Benchmark.\nSpend Waterfall This section provides details about your fees and costs across your DSP and SSPs, and your media productivity. There are definitions for each of the components in this graph in the Industry Benchmark section.\nOptions for this section Exclude MFA From TrueAdSpend: If you click this toggle, you can see what the Spend Waterfall would look like without MFA impressions being identified separately.\nShow Optimization Opportunity: If you click this toggle, you can see what the improvements would be to the IVT, non-measurable, and non-viewable inventory if spend was redirected based on a simulation by Fiducia\u0026ndash;using the TrueKPI Framework. More details about this optimization are in the TrueKPI Optimization Opportunity section below.\nIndustry Benchmarks This section provides insights into how you compare to the industry average using data collected from the 2023 ANA Programmatic Media Supply Chain Transparency Study.\nDefinitions for the metrics can be obtained by hovering your mouse over the help icon (?) to the right of each metric name.\nTo get more information about the graphs in this section hover your mouse over them.\nOptions in this section In this section you can select one of the following options: All Marketplaces, Private Marketplace, Open Marketplace. If you select Private Marketplace or Open Marketplace you will see the Industry Benchmarks section data filtered by this selection. If you select All Marketplaces the data will include both of them.\nTrueKPI Optimization Opportunity This section focuses on the opportunity for you to improve your ad spend productivity using the TrueKPI Framework.\nHow to understand the analysis results displayed in the box to the right Matched Ad Spend: How much ad spend was included in the analysis, which includes all impressions that were deterministically matched between the DSP and Ad Verification platforms.\nTrueImpressions: How many of the impressions met the criteria for a TrueImpression.\nTrueCPM: The cost per thousand impressions that were matched between the DSP and Ad Verification platform and meet the criteria for a True Impression.\nAdditional TrueImpressions: The number of additional impressions that meet the criteria for a TrueImpression after the Show Optimized toggle is clicked.\nAdditional Value: The amount of additional TrueAdSpend that can be realized after the Show Optimized toggle is clicked.\nOptions in this section Breakdown by: This gives you several options to look at the clusters of data in different ways. The default is Supply Path, which is a combination of SSP and domain or application. The definition for Seller ID is provided in the Industry Benchmark section above\nExclude MFA From TrueImpressions: If you click this toggle, you can see how the results in this section would look like if impressions that were served on MFA domains were not included in the TrueImpression definition.\nShow Optimized: If you click this toggle at the top of this section, you will see the results of a simulation performed by Fiducia that shows the potential improvement that is estimated when you have the Log Level Data to shift spend from poorer performing inventory to better\u0026ndash;using the TrueKPI Framework. When you click Show Optimized, the ad spend that previously went to the inventory that was in the red bubbles has been shifted over to inventory that has a significantly higher percent of TrueImpressions and significantly lower CPMs\u0026ndash;and appears as green and yellow bubbles.\nSources of Data for Benchmark\nThe following are the companies that are providing data for the Benchmark besides TAG TrustNet, and links to details about the methodology they use for creating the data.\nAd Fontes Media\nAd Fontes Media is the producer of The Media Bias Chart®, which rates media sources in terms of political bias and reliability.

							value: "Ads.txt",
							label: "<p>The following section describes what ads.txt is and how you should use this information.\nWhat is ads.txt and app-ads.txt Ads.txt and app-ads.txt are standards introduced some years ago by the IAB Tech Lab. They require publishers to list all of the companies who are authorized to sell their inventory in a specific format, at a specific location—for both websites (ads.txt) and applications (app-ads.txt). The objective of these standards are to reduce fraud by allowing buyers to identify those companies who are authorized to sell a publisher’s inventory. If a company is not on this list and is trying to sell a publisher’s inventory then it is likely fraudulent. It is a best practice to only buy from websites and apps that have an ads.txt or app-ads.txt file, and only from sellers who are authorized to sell it, to reduce the chances that you are buying fraudulent inventory. For more information click here: https:\/\/iabtechlab.com\/ads-txt\/.\nHow is TAG TrustNet checking if websites and applications have these files? TAG TrustNet has built its own web crawler to check if ads.txt files are present on websites, and is using a webcrawler from the IAB Tech Lab to check if app-ads.txt files are present on apps.\nWhat does it mean if the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file? As indicated above, the IAB spec requires that these files must contain this authorized seller data in a specific format at a specific location. If the TAG TrustNet report says there is no ads.txt or app-ads.txt file it is likely it means one of the following:\n The file does not exist the domain or app that was provided in the DSP log file was invalid, and it is not possible to find the related ads.txt or app-ads.txt file (for example, comcast.tubitv or j00kdsgdsdk) The file is formatted incorrectly (according to the IAB specification). There is some other technical problem with it meeting the IAB specification.  </p><p>ads.txt</p><p>app-ads.txt</p><p></p>",

							value: "TrueKPI Framework",
							label: "<p>The following section points to where you can get more information about the TrueKPI Framework.\nWhat is the TrueKPI Framework? The TrueKPI Framework builds on the matching of impression log-level data to inform bidding decisions for ad impressions matching a range of pre-defined quality requirements. The creation of value is measured by comparing CPM to TrueCPM.\nTrueImpressions are Impressions that meet the set of quality requirements. The default values for a TrueImpression is that it must have matched data from the DSP and ad verification provider; and be non-IVT, measurable, and viewable according to MRC standards.\nTrueAdSpend is ad spend that is spent on impressions that meet the criteria for being TrueImpressions.\nTrueCPM is the cost paid per a thousand impressions for total ad spend (total ad spend divided by TrueImpressions x 1000).\nHow to calculate TrueCPM? Marketers can define their own custom metric, myTrueImpressions, which can include a range of quality requirements. They may choose to exclude non-brand-suitable impressions, impressions served on MFA websites, and impressions with unnecessary intermediary hops in the supply path (multi-hop reselling). This enables marketers to measure and optimize their ad spend success in a way that aligns with their specific objectives.\nThe TrueCPM is calculated by dividing the total ad spend ($50,000 in the example) by the TrueImpressions (7M), matching the quality requirements of myTrueImpressions, multiplied by 1000. The difference between the Total CPM ($5.0) and the TrueCPM ($7.14) provides the total optimization opportunity ($2.14 or a 30% decrease in TrueCPM).\nWhat Metrics Should You Include in True Impression? Fiducia has a webpage where you can experiment with adding different metrics to your TrueImpression metric. Go to the Calculate your TrueCPM section.\n</p><p></p>",

							value: "Supply Chain Report",
							label: "<p> The Supply Chain Report is only available in advertiser and agency nodes.\n The Supply Chain Report provides a great way to see how well your entire supply chain is meeting any number of your important metrics. The following information is provided in this section:\n Supply Chain Report Overview TrueImpression Other Ad Effectiveness Metrics Cost Efficiency Metrics   Supply Chain Report Overview\nSupply Chain Vendor Types This report uses a Sankey diagram to show the inventory flowing from the publishers on the right all the way to the ad server to the left. Wider lines between the vendor types indicate a greater volume or spend. The four thick vertical lines that are evenly spaced across the report show (from left to right) the ad server(s), DSP(s), exchanges\/SSPs, and Publishers (see below).\nIn addition, there is a key in the lower left of the diagram. This key shows how well the inventory (represented by the horizontal lines between the different supply chain vendors) meet the selected metric based on the color of the line. The color at the top of this key indicates the inventory met the highest level of the selected metric.\nData About the Inventory Between Vendor Types If you hover over the lines that appear between the different vendor types, you will see data about the inventory that is flowing between them. In the example below, the person has hovered over the line between the DSP and the Google AdX exchange–resulting in a tooltips box appearing that provides information specifically about the inventory from Google AdX that the DSP has purchased.\nTAG Certifications You can also see which vendors in your supply chain are certified for any of the four TAG programs (Brand Safey Certified, Certified Against Fraud, and Certified Against Malware). In the example below Brand Safety Certified has been selected. The vendors whose name or column\/box are black indicate that they are currently enrolled in this program, and the ones in red are not. Note: the screen below is used just for illustrative purposes and does not indicate the current status of these companies.\nUsing the Supply Chain Report TrueImpression\nThe objective of having TrueImpression or TrueAdSpend is to have a single metric that you can use to measure overall ad effectiveness. It is suggested by TAG TrustNet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency.\nIn TAG TrustNet the default definition for a TrueImpression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and Ad Verification tool), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the Ad Verification tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request, and can be based on any combination of the metrics that appear within the Supply Chain Report.\nOther Ad Effectiveness Metrics\nThere are a number of other metrics in the Supply Chain Report that allow you to assess your ad effectiveness by answering the following questions:\n Was the impression matched across the log files received from different supply chain vendor types (ad server, Ad Verification, DSP, and Exchange\/SSP)? Was the timestamp of the impression that was recorded in the log files of the ad server, Ad Verification, and DSP platforms within 1 minute? Was the impression recorded only once by both the DSP and exchange? Was the same domain recorded by the Ad Verification tool and DSP for the impression? If the domains match this indicates that there was unlikely to be any domain spoofing. Did the exchange\/SSP purchase the impression directly from the publisher? Does the publisher have an ads.txt file for that impression? Does the exchange\/SSP have an sellers.json file for that impression? Is the publisher ID in the log file from the exchange\/SSP consistent with what is stated in both the ads.txt and sellers.json file? Is the entire supply chain TAG Certified Against Fraud? Is the entire supply chain TAG Brand Safety Certified? Does the impression meet any number of the standard Ad Verification tool criteria (Measureable, Brand Safe, non-IVT, Viewable, etc.)  Cost Efficency Metrics\nThere are a number of metrics in the Supply Chain Report that allow you to assess your cost efficiency by answering the following questions:\n Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data with the impression? Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data, along with the clearing price with the impression? What percent of the ad spend went directly to the publisher for the impression?   </p><p></p>",

This data can then be exported to a CSV file so that it can be used in other platforms.\nFiltering Options It is important to highlight that the data above can be viewed with a few options. This section will describe these options, which include two filters in the top of the screen (just below the date selector), Supply Source and Exchange or Domain. These are located within the blue oval in the screen shot above.\nSupply Source In this filter you have the following options:\n Domains: this will list all of the domains and their corresponding metrics, with no exchange information. Exchanges: this will list all of the exchanges and their corresponding metrics, with no domain information. Exchange and Domains: this will sort the data first by exchange, and then for each exchange list the domains whose inventory was purchased from that exchange.  Exchange or Domain This field will allow you to filter the data in this report to a specific exchange or domain.\nIssues to be aware of for this Report  Verified by TAG column: this status should almost always be known for publishers or exchanges that are certified for one of the TAG programs (such as Brand Safety Certified or Certified Against Fraud). Publishers who are only Verified by TAG may not appear in this report as verified as there are limitations in the data to show this.  </p><p></p>",
