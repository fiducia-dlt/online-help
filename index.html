						{
							value: "Benefits",
							label: "<p>Why should I participate? The network provides accountability and compliance, while driving business value and efficiencies for network participants at a minimal cost compared to the benefits it generates.\nWhat are the participant benefits relative to costs? Based on a cost not to exceed 1% of the advertising spend, the cost\/benefit ratio could reach a high multiple. The network provides a range of benefits in itself, that can be enhanced over system integrations and applications.\nIs a DLT network adding a layer of complexity? DLT is a breakthrough in various industries as a technology solution taking away the complexities and inefficiencies of supply chains by allowing to share and reconcile transaction data among trusted business partners in line with their contractual agreements in a secure and trusted collaborative environment. It most notably takes away the need for lots of different integrations between different organisations, it simplifies legal agreements among participants and allows to automate them over smart contracts, compliance information becomes readily available and always-on reporting contributes to the reduction of expensive reconciliation and auditing.\nIf I already get log files from other supply chain participants, why would I need this? Building log file integrations with every partner in the ecosystem is expensive. Maintaining them when they are up and running is also expensive because it comes with a substantial commitment to keep technology up to date: partners will always change their technology, naming conventions, access settings or update specifications over time. With the TAG Network only one integration is required to get access to the logs of every other network member. Moreover, log file data can be downloaded already pre-reconciled according to defined rules and be used for automated business agreement management. For these reasons, we think that - for most companies - DLT will be a cheaper, more efficient way to get access to log files than other methods.\nDoes the industry need common log file standards if it has DLT? Log files reconciliation requires log file data provided by various individual supply chain participants to be consistent. One way to address this question is to define detailed standards for log file formats, data fields naming conventions, taxonomies and meanings. To come to an agreement on industry logging standards is likely to take time and will require significant investments from adtech vendors to adjust their logging systems.\nAnother approach is to write log files data to the DLT network, where it is automatically harmonised to a common network format at the moment it is written. This approach requires less investments from ad-tech vendors, as it allows to use any formats, taxonomies and naming conventions as long as they can be harmonised to a common format. The only standard required to avoid any ambiguity is to define the meaning of data fields. With this approach the log files reconciliation functionality may be supported by the industry much faster with minimal changes required from ad-tech vendors.\nWhat are the advantages of TAG TrustNet over just using a CV tool (such as IAS or DoubleVerify)? In general, CV Tools provide Ad Effectiveness impression data, blocking and pre-bid tools. They do not address Cost Efficiency (supply chain costs) or Ad Delivery\/reconciliation questions. Specifically, here are the additional benefits of using TAG TrustNet:\n Confirming what site and application your ads actually appeared on. Matched log-level data from the DSP, SSP, ad server and CV company are used to confirm the domain that was recorded for an impression from each platform. If there are differences this can help identify technical problems, misplacement, and domain spoofing. Matching cost data from the DSP and SSP means you can analyse standard verification metrics using dollars or pounds leading to better decisions. TrustNet brings together adherence to industry standards (ads.txt and sellers.json) and certification (TAG) in a single place to improve brand safety, and reduce fraud, malware and piracy.  What does TAG TrustNet deliver for ads.txt that you cannot get from any other solution? There is no other solution available today that is cross-verifying ads with other supply chain data sources. TAG Trustnet will compare the ads.txt file from a publisher with the sellers.json file from an exchange for each impression to ensure these files are present, and that both consistently describe their relationship and identifiers.\n</p><p>money</p><p>payment</p>",

							label: "<p>What is a distributed ledger? It is a type of database which stores transaction records and is consensually shared, synchronized and accessible across multiple organisations, sites, institutions, or geographies. A distributed ledger stands in contrast to a centralized database, which is more prone to failures, cyber-attacks and fraud, as it is administered by a single organisation and therefore has a single point of failure.\nWhat is distributed ledger technology or DLT? It is technology that enables the operation and use of distributed ledgers.\nWhat is the difference between DLT and blockchain? The terms blockchain and DLT are often used interchangeably. Blockchain is a particular type of DLT which was popularized by Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the ledger of transactions is as a sequence of blocks of data linked together through cryptography. The name comes from the fact that the ‘blocks’ are ‘chained’ in this fashion.\nWhat is a DLT network? A DLT Network is a network of computers, called network nodes, which implement a distributed ledger by running specialised software and communication protocols to share, synchronise and access the ledger records. When a ledger update happens, these nodes apply a consensus mechanism to agree on the ordering of transaction records and whether they should be included. The consensus mechanism allows the ledger to be tamper resistant and immutable and containing only confirmed and validated transactions. Because the nodes contain identical replicas of ledger records, users of nodes know that “What you see is what I see” when they access the ledger.\nWhat is a permissioned DLT network? The TAG DLT network is permissioned, as opposed to unpermissioned networks like Bitcoin that are open to anyone. It is pemissioned in three ways, (a) the participants need to agree to the governance and control principles to participate to the network, (b) the participants need to be approved to become network members, (c) the participants need to comply with the network minimum requirements at all times.\nWhat is a smart contract? A smart contract is a computer program stored in a distributed ledger network wherein the outcome of any execution of the program is recorded on the distributed ledger. A smart contract might represent terms in a contract in law and create a legally enforceable obligation under the legislation of an applicable jurisdiction. Smart contracts allow organisations to automate their business relationships using software code with enforceability based on the distributed ledger records.\n</p><p></p>",

The following information is provided in this section:\n Supply Chain Monitor Overview Qualified impression Other Ad Effectiveness Metrics Cost Efficiency Metrics   Supply Chain Monitor Overview Supply Chain Vendor Types The following screenshot shows the where the different supply chain vendor types (ad server, DSP, exchanges\/SSPs, and publishers) appear within the Supply Chain Monitor.\nIn addition, there is a key in the lower left of the diagram. This key shows how well the inventory (represented by a line) between the different supply chain vendors meet the selected metric (which in this case is \u0026ldquo;Qualified\u0026rdquo;) based on the color of the line. The color at the top of this key indicates that 95% or more of the inventory was qualified..\nData About the Inventory Between Vendor Types If you hover over the lines that appear between the different vendor types, you will see data about the inventory that is flowing between them. In the example below, the person has hovered over the line between the DSP and the Google AdX exchange, resulting in a tooltips box appearing that provides information specifically about the inventory from Google AdX that the DSP has purchased.\nTAG Certifications You can also see which vendors in your supply chain are verified or certified for any of the four TAG programs (Brand Safey Certified, Certified Against Fraud, Certified Against Malware, and Certified Against Piracy). In the example below, Certified Against Fraud has been selected. The vendors whose name or column\/box are black indicate that they are currently enrolled in this program, and the ones in red are not. Note: the screen below is used just for illustrative purposes and does not indicate the actual status of these companies.\nAvailable Metrics As you can see from the image below there are a number of metrics available in the Supply Chain Monitor. You can find definitions for all metrics in the Glossary.\nUsing the Supply Chain Monitor Qualified Impression The objective of having a qualified impression is to have a single metric that you can use to measure the overall ad effectiveness of your ad spend. It is suggested by TAG Trustnet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency.\nIn TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request, and can be based on any combination of the metrics that appear within the Supply Chain Monitor.\nOther Ad Effectiveness Metrics There are a number of other metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your ad effectiveness by answering the following questions:\n Was the impression matched across the log files received from different supply chain vendor types (ad server, CV, DSP,and Exchange\/SSP)? Was the timestamp of the impression that was recorded in the log files of the ad server, CV, and DSP platforms within 1 minute? Was the impression recorded only once by the DSP? Was the same domain recorded by the CV tool and DSP for the impression? If the domains match this indicates that there was unlikely to be any domain spoofing. Did the exchange\/SSP purchase the impression directly from the publisher? Is the entire supply chain for that impression TAG Verified? Does the publisher have an ads.txt file for that impression? Does the exchange\/SSP have an sellers.json file for that impression? Is the publisher ID in the log file from the exchange\/SSP consistent with what is stated in both the ads.txt and sellers.json file? Is the entire supply chain TAG Certified Against Fraud? Is the entire supply chain TAG Brand Safety Certified? Does the impression meet any number of the standard CV tool criteria (Measureable, Brand Safe, non-IVT, Viewable, etc.)  Cost Efficency Metrics There are a number of metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your cost efficiency by answering the following questions:\n Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data with the impression? Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data, along with the clearing price with the impression? What percent of the ads spend went directly to the publisher for the impression?   </p><p></p>",

							value: "Governance",
							label: "<p>Why should trade associations set up a DLT network? To resolve the industry’s trust problem by enforcing measurable industry standards, certifications and legal requirements across the industry on an ongoing basis over an always-on decentralised industry wide network, supported by a DLT platform and operated in the best interest of the industry as a whole. This cannot be achieved with centralised solutions controlled by single entities.\nWho defines the requirements and makes the decisions? The network governance entity that is formed by trade bodies, and other industry representatives (this is to be further defined) as representatives of the industry as a whole.\nWho operates the network? As a trade body representing the entire industry, TAG is planned to act as the network operator under the supervision of the network governance entity.\nHow do the network requirements get enforced? Requirements that are measurable over the data provided to the platform get enforced over the DLT platform. Requirements that are not measurable will go through a traditional audit process.\nHow does the network fight fraud? Any company joining the network needs to comply with minimum requirements to become a network participant allowed to use the network. By providing access to information on the advertising delivery to be reconciled among supply chain participants, the detection of discrepancies between them is providing a signal for potential fraud. The company may lose this right and be prevented from participating to transactions should the ledger provide evidence that the company does not comply with network requirements at all times.\nWho does get access to the data? A consent framework will be activated as part of the network functionality. Depending on the case, access to data may require one or more parties to provide their consents. As all consents can be easily provided by all parties using the network’s API or the Live Compliance user interface, this procedure won’t be time consuming. Consents are automatically enforced within the network’s infrastructure. The data provider remains in control of the access as he voluntarily can decide whether to report data or not.\nWho can build applications? Anyone in the industry can contribute to the development of the network application ecosystem using the platform API providing access to the distributed ledger.\nDoes the network create a new monopoly? For the TAG DLT network to deliver all its benefits it has to be widely adopted across the industry as a “new standard” in the way to conduct business. This is the reason the network needs to be set-up by the industry for the industry as a consortium under an open governance that truly represents the whole industry. Rather than creating a monopoly, the network is helping to create a fair and open marketplace based on trust with the enforcement of self-defined rules that all participants across the supply chain agree to implement consistently at all times.\n</p><p>handle</p>",

This data can then be exported to a CSV file so that it can be used in other platforms.\nFiltering Options It is important to highlight that the data above can be viewed with a few options. This section will describe these options, which include two filters in the top of the screen (just below the date selector), Supply Source and Exchange or Domain.\nSupply Source In this filter you have the following options:\n Domains: this will list all of the domains and their corresponding metrics, with no exchange information. Exchanges: this will list all of the exchanges and their corresponding metrics, with no domain information. Exchange and Domains: this will sort the data first by exchange, and then for each exchange list the domains whose inventory was purchased from that exchange.  Exchange or Domain This field will allow you to filter the data in this report to a specific exchange or domain.\n</p><p></p>",
