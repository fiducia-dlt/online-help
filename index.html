The goals may include target audience, brand safety, fraud, and other criteria.   Ad Spend The total amount of money spent to purchase impressions programmatically, which includes both delivery costs and media spend.   Ad Spend Productivity A measurement of buying ads using the least amount of ad spend to meet the goals of a campaign. This measure combines both ad effectiveness and cost efficiency   Ads.txt implemented Ad spend or impressions where the publisher has an ads.txt and app-ads.txt file.   Allowed Ad spend or impressions meeting the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign and with no violations (blocks for inappropriate content, IVT, or App\/Site\/Language. (DoubleVerify only)   Brand safe Ad spend or impressions determined to be brand safe as determined by the CV tool.   Confirmed by ad server, CV tool, and DSP Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, CV tool, and DSP   Confirmed by ad server, CV tool, DSP, and Exchange (beta) Ad spend or impressions that were recorded by all of the following systems: ad server, CV tool, DSP, and exchange   Confirmed by CV tool Ad spend or impressions that have been recorded by both the CV tool and DSP.   Confirmed publisher domain Ad spend or impressions where the ad server, CV tool, and DSP all recorded the same domain.   Consistency of ads.txt, sellers.json, and log-level data The seller ID from the SSP log file matches the seller ID (also called the Publisher’s Account ID) in the ads.txt or app-ads.txt file AND the seller ID in the sellers.json file   Consistent timestamps Ad spend or impressions that had timestamps recorded within 1 minute for the ad server, CV tool, and DSP.   Cost Efficiency A measurement of how successfully ads are being purchased using the least amount of the ad spend.   Delivery Costs The amount of ad spend paid for impressions that includes everything except the payment to the publisher. Delivery costs typically includes platform fees paid to intermediaries (including ad servers, DSPs and SSPs) and data.   DSP and Exchange provided cost breakdown (beta) Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost   DSP and Exchange provided cost breakdown with matching clearing price (beta) Ad spend or impressions where the DSP and Exchange have disclosed the media cost and clearing price records match   Exchange works with publisher directly Ad spend or impressions where the exchange works with the publisher directly based on its log file records and sellers.json data, along with the publishers ads.txt or app-ads.txt file   Live Compliance Performing compliance checks based on impression log-level data in near real-time of a supply chain to industry regulations, standards, and certifications.   Live Reconciliation Harmonizing, matching, and recording impression delivery log records across a supply chain in near real-time.   Measurable Ad spend or impressions were able to be measured for viewability as determined by the CV tool.   Media Spend The amount of ad spend paid for impressions that goes to the publisher.   Monitored Ad spend or impressions where the DoubleVerify monitoring services were applied, were not blocked and had no violations from DoubleVerify. (DoubleVerify only)   Node Manager The TAG TrustNet product that members log into to configure their node, manage users, manage data and access the Supply Chain monitor or other network functionalities.   Non-Blocked Requests Ad spend or impressions where the requests were not blocked because they met the blocking criteria for the DoubleVerify Digital IQ campaign. (DoubleVerify only)   Non-IVT Ad Spend or impression is determined to be delivered to a human as determined by the CV tool.   % Spend to Publisher The percent of the ad spend that goes to the publisher for ad spend or impressions.   Qualified Qualified impressions are impressions that meet a set of requirements to measure ad effectiveness. TAG TrustNet enables members to define their own requirements and to evaluate data reconciled across the supply chain against them. TAG TrustNet recommends defining qualified impression requirements based on ad quality, supply chain transparency and data consistency metrics. In TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same.   Qualified Viewable Ad spend or impressions that are both qualified (see Qualified above) AND viewable.   Sellers.json implemented Ad spend or impressions where the exchange or SSP has a sellers.json file.   Supply Chain is TAG BSC Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Verified   Supply Chain is TAG CAF Ad spend or impressions where all supply chain participants are TAG Verified   Supply Chain Monitor The TAG TrustNet dashboard for an agency or advertiser that uses a Sankey diagram to show data about the flow of inventory across programmatic participants, from the ad server to the publishers.   Unduplicated impressions Ad spend or impressions where the impressions were reported as unique by the DSP.   Viewable according to CV Ad spend or impressions are determined to be viewable according to the CV tool being used.    </p><p></p>",

							label: "<p> responsible advertising for a responsible industry Over the last decade Real-Time Bidding (RTB) created massive efficiency for the digital advertising marketplace in opening large volumes of inventory, driving down prices and creating the opportunity for smaller sites and apps to thrive. Today it has become a large $200B market that continues to grow at an accelerated pace with a supply chain that remains complex, fragmented, partly opaque and could be even more efficient. In a context where decisions are increasingly made by technology, traditional processes do not apply and there is a need to bring a technological solution to what is essentially a technological problem.\nAs a global cross-industry initiative, TAG TrustNet is taking the industry to the next level as an always-on collaborative network providing the tools to certify the supply chain and allow everyone to be accountable, make responsible decisions and improve efficiency.\nTAG TrustNet achieves this by automating the reconciliation of data across the supply chain and recording it in an immutable shared ledger as Shared Truth: a unified record for every single ad running through the supply chain made available in near real-time.\nWith Shared Truth, TAG TrustNet enables what can be defined as Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles:\n Know your business partners: every record can be tracked back to the legal entities that are part of a transaction Know their business practices: every record gets cross-checked and verified based on financial and qualitative metrics Make timely informed business decisions: every record gets reconciled and can be acted on in near real-time  As an always-on solution, TAG TrustNet sets a major industry milestone:\n For the industry as a whole by allowing everyone to act responsibly by conducting business transactions only with identified business partners; For advertisers and agencies by increasing cost efficiency and ad effectiveness, resulting in improved brand safety and ad spend productivity; For intermediaries and publishers by getting the opportunity to access to a larger share of ad spend as identified business partners agreeing to share impression data; and For all members by reducing operating costs over the automation of data reconciliation in a data secure and private context.  Accessing TAG TrustNet is a free and easy process. Members sign a membership agreement, get verified as an existing legal business entity, get identified by a tracking ID and agree to share their impression data with their business partners through TAG TrustNet based on member requirements. In a second step, after signing a licensing agreement, a dedicated network node gets activated over which data can be imported, shared and exported. Access to data remains at all times under the control of the data owner.\nTAG TrustNet’s objective is for the entire digital advertising industry to adopt and implement the 3 principles of Responsible Advertising by becoming members and leveraging TAG TrustNet to shape a responsible future for our industry.\nThe time for TRUST is now! </p><p></p>",

							value: "Dashboard",
							label: "<p> The Dashboard screen is only available on advertiser or agency nodes.\n The purpose of the dashboard is to allow you to easily see the most critical metrics that are tracked by TAG TrustNet everytime you login. For most metrics you have the option to set a goal so that you can see how well these metrics are doing against your goals.\nThe dashboard is comprised of a number of individual panels showing metrics and goals called widgets. These widgets are grouped into two categories, Ad Effectiveness and Cost Efficiency. The widgets can be added, changed, and deleted, in order to customize the dashboard for your account. The following provides information about how to make these changes.\nTime Period The time period for data that is used for the entire dashboard is set at the upper left of the dashboard. You can set this to any time period that you want and this setting will be used when you login in the future.\nChange Existing Widgets Modify Existing Widgets To change the settings for an existing widget:\n Within the widget that you want to change, click on the icon in the top-right corner with the three vertical dots. Select Edit Make the desired changes Click the Save Widget button.  Move Existing Widgets You can easily change the position of widgets on the dashboard by doing the following:\n Hover over the widget that you want to move. A small grid of six dots will appear to the left of the widget name. Click (and hold) on top of the dots and move the widget to the desired location. Once the widget is at the desire location release the mouse button.  Note: You are not allowed to move widgets to different categories (for example from Ad Effectiveness to Cost Efficiency, or vice-versa).\nDelete Existing Widgets In order to delete a widget follow these steps:\n Within the widget that you want to change, click on the icon in the top-right corner with the three vertical dots. Select Remove.  Add New Widgets To add a widget follow these steps:\n At the top-right of the dashboard screen click on the \u002b Add Widget button. Select whether you want it to be a a Goal Widget or Over Time widget. As you select these options you can see a preview of what they will look like to the right. Select the metric that you want to use from the drop-down menu. Select whether you want to use Ad Spend or Impressions as the basis for the metrics. Select whether you want to show the metric value or a % in the widget (the preview will show how these options will be displayed) Choose a goal to be used to measure the performance of the metric. This is optional. Click the Add Widget button.  Once the widget is created you can move it to the desired location in the dashboard. Please refer to Move Existing Widgets above.\nNote: most, but not all settings can be changed once you have created a widget. Once you have selected a widget to be a Goal Widget or Over Time widget you cannot change it to be the other type once you select Add Widget. If you want to make this change your only option is to delete the widget and create another one.\n</p><p></p>",

							value: "Supply Chain Monitor",
							label: "<p> The Supply Chain Monitor is only available in advertiser and agency nodes.\n The Supply Chain Monitor provides a great way to see how well your entire supply chain is meeting any number of your important metrics. The following information is provided in this section:\n Supply Chain Monitor Overview Qualified impression Other Ad Effectiveness Metrics Cost Efficiency Metrics   Supply Chain Monitor Overview\nSupply Chain Vendor Types This report uses a Sankey diagram to show the inventory flowing from the publishers on the right all the way to the ad server to the left. Wider lines between the vendor types indicate a greater volume or spend. The four thick vertical lines that are evenly spaced across the report show (from left to right) the ad server(s), DSP(s), exchanges\/SSPs, and Publishers (see below).\nIn addition, there is a key in the lower left of the diagram. This key shows how well the inventory (represented by the horizontal lines between the different supply chain vendors) meet the selected metric based on the color of the line. The color at the top of this key indicates the inventory met the highest level of the selected metric.\nData About the Inventory Between Vendor Types If you hover over the lines that appear between the different vendor types, you will see data about the inventory that is flowing between them. In the example below, the person has hovered over the line between the DSP and the Google AdX exchange–resulting in a tooltips box appearing that provides information specifically about the inventory from Google AdX that the DSP has purchased.\nTAG Certifications You can also see which vendors in your supply chain are certified for any of the four TAG programs (Brand Safey Certified, Certified Against Fraud, Certified Against Malware, and Certified Against Piracy). In the example below, Certified Against Fraud has been selected. The vendors whose name or column\/box are black indicate that they are currently enrolled in this program, and the ones in red are not. Note: the screen below is used just for illustrative purposes and does not indicate the actual status of these companies.\nAvailable Metrics As you can see from the image below there are a number of metrics available in the Supply Chain Monitor to choose from. You can find definitions for all metrics in the Glossary.\nUsing the Supply Chain Monitor Qualified Impression\nThe objective of having qualified impression or ad spend is to have a single metric that you can use to measure overall ad effectiveness. It is suggested by TAG TrustNet that this metric be defined by having an impression meet several requirements in ad quality, supply chain transparency, and data consistency.\nIn TAG TrustNet the default definition for a qualified impression is that it must be matched with data from all available buy-side platforms (including DSP, ad server and CV), is measurable, brand safe, non-IVT, and the domains that are reported by the CV tool and DSP are the same. This definition can be customized on request, and can be based on any combination of the metrics that appear within the Supply Chain Monitor.\nOther Ad Effectiveness Metrics\nThere are a number of other metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your ad effectiveness by answering the following questions:\n Was the impression matched across the log files received from different supply chain vendor types (ad server, CV, DSP, and Exchange\/SSP)? Was the timestamp of the impression that was recorded in the log files of the ad server, CV, and DSP platforms within 1 minute? Was the impression recorded only once by both the DSP and SSP? Was the same domain recorded by the CV tool and DSP for the impression? If the domains match this indicates that there was unlikely to be any domain spoofing. Did the exchange\/SSP purchase the impression directly from the publisher? Does the publisher have an ads.txt file for that impression? Does the exchange\/SSP have an sellers.json file for that impression? Is the publisher ID in the log file from the exchange\/SSP consistent with what is stated in both the ads.txt and sellers.json file? Is the entire supply chain TAG Certified Against Fraud? Is the entire supply chain TAG Brand Safety Certified? Does the impression meet any number of the standard CV tool criteria (Measureable, Brand Safe, non-IVT, Viewable, etc.)  Cost Efficency Metrics\nThere are a number of metrics in the Supply Chain Monitor that allow you to assess your cost efficiency by answering the following questions:\n Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data with the impression? Did both the DSP and exchange\/SSP provide cost data, along with the clearing price with the impression? What percent of the ad spend went directly to the publisher for the impression?   </p><p></p>",

							label: "<p> The capabilities described below apply to all node types (except where noted).\n This documentation will provide information on how user accounts are created, managed, and activated\/inactivated, as well as providing details on the access options for accounts.\nRequesting a user account Every company who has a node on TAG TrustNet will have at least one person who can create user accounts for all users in that node (the Node User Administrator). If a new user account is required, the person who is the Node User Administrator(s) for the node at that company should be contacted to set it up. The information that will be needed to set up a new account is:\n First and last name Email address Type of role. See below for the types of roles available. Country restrictions (optional) (advertiser and agency nodes only) Advertiser restrictions (optional) (agency nodes only)  If you don\u0026rsquo;t know who the Node User Administrator is for your company, please contact us at support@tagtrust.net.\nCreating a user account For Node User Administrators, here is how you create a new user account:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. On the top-right of the screen below, click on the \u002b NEW USER button. Enter the user name (first and last) and the email address. Select the user role (see below for a description for each one). Advertiser and agency nodes only: Review the Countries setting to see if it is correct Agency nodes only: If one or more countries have been selected, and if the Business Metrics Viewer role has been selected, review the Restrict by Advertisers field to make sure it is correct. See below for more details. Click on the Create User button on the bottom of the screen.  Once this last step is completed the user will automatically receive an email with a link to set the password for their new account. This email will include all information needed to log into the account including the following:\n the login URL the node name the user\u0026rsquo;s account name (which is the user\u0026rsquo;s email address)  This email will be sent from TAG TrustNet and the subject will be New TAG TrustNet Account.\nSettings for user accounts The following describes in more detail the settings for setting-up user accounts.\nUser Roles  Node User Administrator: This role is able to create new accounts for users in the node, as well as view all screens for all countries (for advertiser and agency nodes) and all advertisers (for agency nodes). This role can also create user accounts that can be Node User Administrators. Business Metrics Viewer (advertiser or agency node only): The access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Dashboard and Insights options in the top navigation bar. Data Manager:  for advertiser and agency nodes, the access for this role will be limited to the screens accessed from the Node Health option in the top navigation bar. for all ad server, CV, DSP, Exchange\/SSP, and Publisher nodes the access for this role will be limited to the Node option in the top navigation bar.    If the Node User Administrator has been selected, no other roles can be selected (since the Node User Administrator can view all screens that are available to the other roles). The other two roles can be selected in any combination (based on their availability).\nCountries (advertiser and agency nodes only) This will allow users who have been assigned the Business Metrics Viewer role to have their access to be restricted to one or more countries. This setting does not impact the screens or data available to the Data Manager role.\nAdvertiser Restriction (agency node only) When the Business Metrics Viewer role is selected, and at least one country has been selected, the access for a user can be restricted to one or more advertisers. This setting will impact all screens that the Business Metrics Viewer has access to (for details on these screens, see User Roles above).\nMaking an account active or inactive The user\u0026rsquo;s account can be changed to be active or inactive by the is active control. If it is inactive the user is not allowed to login to their TAG TrustNet node. Accounts are not allowed to be deleted in order to maintain user data integrity.\nResetting a password If a user has forgotten their password or has been locked out of their account after 3 failed logins, the Node User Adminstrator should follow these steps to reset the password:\n Login to your TAG TrustNet account On the top navigation bar select Users. Select the All users view. Find the row that has the account that needs the password reset. On the far right of that row there is an icon with three dots. Click it and select \u0026ldquo;Reset Password\u0026rdquo; Click the link Send Link by Email and an email will automatically be sent to the user to reset their password (the email will be sent from TAG TrustNet and the subject will be Reset Password). Alternatively you can send this manually by copying the link in the dialog window.  Other Account Information Time-out If a users account is inactive for 30 minutes the user will need to login again.\n3 Failed Logins If a user has tried unsuccessfully to login 3 times, the account will be locked. The only way the user can get access to their account is to have their password reset by the Node User Administrator. Instructions on how to do this are above (see Resetting a password).\nMandatory Password Changes A node can be configured to require that all user passwords be changed every 60 days. Contact TAG TrustNet support to have this enabled.\n</p><p>access, login, log-in</p>",

							label: "<p>Benefits Why should I participate?    TAG TrustNet is a cross-industry network running an always-on platform making the industry more accountable, responsible, and efficient. The platform was validated with major brands, agencies and tech vendors over a 2-year pilot and is positioned to contribute to the continued growth of the industry by enabling Responsible Advertising based on 3 principles: know your business partners, know their business practices, make timely informed decisions. While providing accountability and compliance, TAG TrustNet is driving business value and efficiencies for network participants at a minimal cost compared to the benefits it generates.   What are the participant benefits relative to costs?    Based on a cost in a 1 to 2% range of the advertising spend depending on volume, the cost\/benefit ratio can reach a high multiple depending on how the reconciled data is used. The network provides a range of direct benefits, that can be enhanced over system integrations and applications.   Is a DLT network adding a layer of complexity?    DLT is a breakthrough in various industries as a technology solution taking away the complexities and inefficiencies of supply chains. It allows companies to share and reconcile transaction data among trusted business partners in line with their contractual agreements in a secure and trusted collaborative environment. It most notably takes away the need for lots of different integrations between different organisations, simplifies legal agreements among participants, and allows to automate them over smart contracts. Compliance information becomes readily available and always-on reporting contributes to the reduction of expensive reconciliation and auditing.   If I already get log files from other supply chain participants, why would I need this?    Building log file integrations with every partner in the ecosystem is expensive. Maintaining them when they are up and running is also expensive because it comes with a substantial commitment to keep technology up to date: over time partners will change their technology, naming conventions, access settings or specifications. With TAG TrustNet only one integration is required to get access to the logs of every other network member. Moreover, log file data can be downloaded already pre-reconciled according to defined rules and used for automated business agreement management. For these reasons, for most companies DLT will be a cheaper, more efficient way to get access log files than other methods.   Does the industry need common log file standards if it has DLT?    Log files reconciliation requires log file data provided by various individual supply chain participants to be consistent. One way to address this question is to define detailed standards for log file formats, data fields naming conventions, taxonomies and meanings. To come to an agreement on industry logging standards is taking time and will require significant investments from adtech vendors to adjust their logging systems.\nThe other approach is to write log file data to the TAG TrustNet DLT network, where it is automatically harmonised to a common network format at the moment it is written. This approach requires less investments from ad-tech vendors, as it allows to use any formats, taxonomies and naming conventions as long as they can be harmonised to a common format. The only standard required to avoid any ambiguity is to define the meaning of data fields. With this approach the log files reconciliation functionality may be supported by the industry much faster with minimal changes required from ad-tech vendors.\n   How does TAG TrustNet compliment the use of Content Verfication (CV) providers?    In general, CV Providers deliver ad effectiveness impression data, blocking and pre-bid tools. They do not cover cost efficiency (supply chain costs), ad delivery\/reconciliation, and compliance to industry standards. By incorporating your CV data within TAG TrustNet you are able to:\nConfirm what site and application ads actually appeared on. Matched log-level data from the DSP, SSP, ad server and CV company are used to confirm the domain that was recorded for an impression from each platform. If there are differences this can help identify technical problems, misplacement, and domain spoofing.\nMatching cost data from the DSP and SSP means you can analyse standard verification metrics leading to better business decisions.\nTAG TrustNet allows you to evaluate how industry standards (ads.txt and sellers.json) and certifications (TAG) get implemented in a single place to improve brand safety, and reduce fraud, malware and piracy.\nTAG TrustNet reconciles supply chain participants data producing a single shared truth that can be used for discrepancy management, managing partner and tag deployments and improving operational efficiency.\n   What does TAG TrustNet deliver for ads.txt that you cannot get from any other solution?    There is no other solution available today that allows to cross-verify impression log files of ads coming from multiple supply chain data sources. TAG TrustNet allows to compare the ads.txt file from a publisher, the sellers.json file from an exchange, and the impression log file from the SSP to ensure these files exist and consistently describe their relationship and the seller\/buyer identifiers with what appears in the log file.   Compliance What has TAG TrustNet done to comply with data protection laws?    TAG TrustNet does not allow its members to process Personal Data or otherwise link data within the TAG TrustNet with other data held by a participant to create Personal Data. Every TAG TrustNet member shall comply with TAG TrustNet Member Requirements, which state that log-level data provided for ingestion into TAG TrustNet shall not include any Personal Data and, as such, should fall outside of the scope of data protection laws, including, without limitation, the GDPR and the CCPA. All Personal Data, and any data fields which represent “pseudonymous data,” shall be removed before the underlying dataset is ingested into TAG TrustNet.  “Personal Data” means any information defined as “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or other similar term under applicable data protection laws.   While impression timestamps and oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs that are ingested into TAG TrustNet might be considered “pseudonymous data” in some circumstances, it is “anonymous data” in this case because:\n\u0026ndash; It is not possible for Fiducia, as a platform provider for TAG TrustNet, to use this data to identify an individual and;\n\u0026ndash; TAG TrustNet obfuscates these data fields when they are exported to reasonably prevent anyone from linking TAG TrustNet impression records to an individual (see below for more details). In addition to the above, Fiducia, as a platform provider, takes the following steps to reduce risks of re-identifiability of data ingested by, or exported from, TAG TrustNet, so as to achieve the standards of anonymization under applicable data protection laws (such as by not allowing re-identification via the “means reasonably likely to be used” by a third party, per the GDPR standard for determining whether data is “identifiable”):\n\u0026ndash; For all supported data sources, the TAG TrustNet Node Data Connectors filter any data fields that represent Personal Data from processing in the TAG TrustNet. Only data fields outlined in TAG TrustNet Member Requirements are ingested to by TAG TrustNet for processing.\n\u0026ndash; When data is exported by TAG TrustNet Members to external databases, the TAG TrustNet Node obfuscates oRTB Bid Request Impression ID, oRTB Bid Request ID, and Timestamp data fields as follows. oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs and oRTB Bid Request IDs are replaced with anonymous impression IDs, which cannot be linked back to original oRTB Bid Request Impression IDs or oRTB Bid Request IDs. Timestamps are rounded to 1-hour intervals.\n   General Information What is a distributed ledger?    It is a type of database which stores transaction records and is consensually shared, synchronized and accessible across multiple organisations, sites, institutions, or geographies. A distributed ledger stands in contrast to a centralized database, which is more prone to failures, cyber-attacks and fraud, as it is administered by a single organisation and therefore has a single point of failure.\n   What is distributed ledger technology or DLT?    The terms blockchain and DLT are often used interchangeably. Blockchain is a particular type of DLT which was popularized by Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, the ledger of transactions is as a sequence of blocks of data linked together through cryptography. The name comes from the fact that the ‘blocks’ are ‘chained’ in this fashion.   What is a DLT network?    A DLT Network is a network of computers, called network nodes, which implement a distributed ledger by running specialised software and communication protocols to share, synchronise and access the ledger records. When a ledger update happens, these nodes apply a consensus mechanism to agree on the ordering of transaction records and whether they should be included. The consensus mechanism allows the ledger to be tamper resistant and immutable and containing only confirmed and validated transactions. Because the nodes contain identical replicas of ledger records, users of nodes know that “What you see is what I see” when they access the ledger.   What is a permissioned DLT network?    TAG TrustNet is a permissioned network, as opposed to unpermissioned networks like Bitcoin that are open to anyone. It is pemissioned in three ways: (a) the participants need to agree to the governance and control principles to participate to the network, (b) the participants need to be approved to become network members, (c) the participants need to comply with the network minimum requirements at all times.\n   What is a smart contract?    A smart contract is a computer program stored in a distributed ledger network wherein the outcome of any execution of the program is recorded on the distributed ledger. A smart contract might represent terms in a contract in law and create a legally enforceable obligation under the legislation of an applicable jurisdiction. Smart contracts allow organisations to automate their business relationships using software code with enforceability based on the distributed ledger records.   Governance Why should trade associations set up a DLT network?    To resolve the industry accountability problem – which in a technology driven industry essentially requires a technology solution – by implementing an always-on decentralised technology infrastructure able to reconcile impression data in the context of an industry network, to enforce measurable industry standards, certifications, and legal requirements on an ongoing basis. This cannot be achieved with centralised solutions controlled by individual entities but requires an industry-wide approach and trade associations are best placed to play that role.   How do the network requirements get enforced?    Requirements that are measurable over the impression log data provided to the platform get enforced over the DLT platform. Requirements that are not measurable will go through a traditional audit process.   How does the network fight fraud?    Any company joining the network needs to comply with minimum requirements to become a TAG TrustNet member allowed to use the network over a node. This includes the need to get identified as a legitimate legal entity and to be issued a tracking TAG-ID. The requirements define the data that needs to be included in the data feeds of providers. The reconciliation of this data among supply chain participants allows a company to detect discrepancies between the different data sets providing a signal for potential fraud. Under certain conditions, a company may be prevented from participating to transactions should the ledger provide evidence that it does not comply with network requirements at all times.   Who gets access to the data?    A consent framework is activated as part of the network functionality. Depending on the case, access to data may require one or more parties to provide their consents. As all consents can easily be provided by all parties over their nodes this process is easily managed using the network functionality. Consents are automatically enforced and data providers remain in control of access as they voluntarily can decide whether to report data or not.   Who can build applications?    Anyone in the industry can contribute to the development of the network application ecosystem using the platform API providing access to the distributed ledger.   Why is wide industry adoption important?    For TAG TrustNet to deliver its full benefits to its members it has to be widely adopted across the industry as a joint collaborative effort to implement a “new standard” in the way to conduct business in a more accountable, responsible, sustainable and efficient way. The network is helping to create a fair and open marketplace based on accountability with the enforcement of self-defined rules that all participants across the supply chain agree to implement consistently at all times.   Membership for Intermediaries and Publishers What is the process to join TAG TrustNet as an intermediary or publisher?    For intermediaries (such as ad servers, CVs, DSPs, and Exchanges\/SSPs) and publishers here is a summary of the process to join:\n Become a TAG Member and be verified as a legitimate legal entity with a TAG ID Agree to the network requirements and sign the TAG TrustNet Membership Agreement Sign the TAG TrustNet Licensing \u0026amp; Service Level Agreement Complete the Node and Data Assessment Form Get a Data Connector built and approved Get a Network Node set-up allowing to import and share data with other network members Set up ongoing data feed(s) based on advertiser requests     What does is the cost to join as an intermediary or publisher    For TAG members with a TAG ID the TAG TrustNet membership is free. To have an active node on the network to share data, the only cost is a one-time activation fee of $5k, $10k or $15k depending on annual digital advertising revenue. The activation fee is waived for all companies joining TAG TrustNet on or before December 31, 2021.   How do I send data to TAG TrustNet?    Data is to be sent to the network using standard delivery mechanisms. It usually gets usually delivery to a cloud bucket (Amazon s3, Google GCP) or accessed via SnowFlake or other access points. As part of the data integration process, members are required to provide an example or a live data feed which will be used to create a TAG TrustNet Network Adaptor that will automatically ingest, match and harmonise data within the network.   Why do I need to provide logs?    Log-level data must be provided by all TAG TrustNet Members for their impression data to be deterministically matched across supply chains.   How is my data used by the network?    Member data is ingested into the network and matched with impressions data from other network members sharing the same identifier that is activated at the request of advertisers. The matched data is recorded in the distributed ledger and (i) shared with the advertiser over the TAG TrustNet Supply Chain Monitor and (ii) included in the reconciled data that can get exported by advertisers into their own systems.   What control do I have over my data?    A consent framework is part of the network functionality. Access to data may require one or more parties to provide consent and all consents are automatically enforced within the network infrastructure. The data provider always remains in control of data access.   Technical Questions What is the Reconciliation SDK?    The Reconciliation SDK (software development kit) is a tool developed by Fiducia that can be installed on publisher sites and applications. It creates a log file record ID map when an ad is requested that can then be shared with every supply chain participant. With this ID map, log files of various supply chain participants can all be matched deterministically line to line. The SDK is preserving consumer privacy and cannot be used for consumer tracking.   Does TAG TrustNet have any additional tag requirements for advertisers or agencies?    TAG TrustNet uses existing log files that supply chain partners can already provide. The only time an additional tag is needed is when the TAG Reconciliation Service is deployed. Whether or not this is needed gets determined as part of the initial supply chain mapping exercise.   </p>",
